Tumor tissue directly from surgical resection is used to establish patient-derived primary cell lines and tumor lines that grow as brain xenografts in mice. These patient-derived cancer models are subjected to high throughput screening to identify novel therapeutic targets. We recently used a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify PHF5a as a novel gene required for glioblastoma (Hubert et. al., Genes and Development 27:1032-1045; 2013). This work showed that PHF5a helps with proper messenger RNA splicing in cancer cells and provides a lead for novel glioblastoma therapies. @ @The Olson lab pioneered the clinical use of small cysteine-rich proteins called knottins or when it conjugated a fluorescent dye to chlorotoxin to develop 'Tumor Paint'. Tumor Paint accumulates in cancer cells and is used to help surgeons distinguish tumor from healthy brain tissue during surgery. It is currently in clinical trials. Building on this work, the Olson, Strong, Paddison, and Simon labs have developed a new peptide drug discovery platform at Fred Hutch.

He has been developing proteomics-based tools to facilitate biological research.  Specifically, he has pursued a proteomics approach to systematically identify the direct substrates of protein kinases.  Mapping kinase and substrate relationships is critical for elucidating kinases functions and their signaling pathways.  Despite the enormous interests and efforts in the field, it has remained a technical challenge, and the progress has been slow.  He developed an in vitro-based method for proteome-wide identification of protein kinase substrates in cell lysates.  This method utilized tools in biology, protein chemistry, and mass spectrometry and identified an unprecedented large number of candidate substrates for the human CDK2 kinase.  Current in vitro and in vivo approaches suffer the shortcoming of large false-positive identifications due to non-physiological settings or indirect hits.  He is now working on a cell-based approach that would minimize false-positive identifications due to the non-physiological settings while maintaining direct kinase-substrate relationships.","https://www.systemsbiology.org/yong-chi","","Colorectal","Staff Scientist","Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center","","7/25/14 10:46","LaFranier, Daniel J","Chi, Yong.jpg","TRUE","Clinical Research","110","Item","sites/cancer-center/sttr/Lists/Faculty"],
