Communications between the different components of the tumor influence its growth, its response to therapy, and its ability to metastasize.

This enables them to follow the behaviors of and the interactions between cancer and myeloid cells in tumors during progression or treatment.

This approach has led to the finding that activated fibroblasts in the tumor stroma mediate immune suppression in several mouse models of cancer, including the autochthonous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the Tuveson lab.  Our understanding of the basis of immune suppression is evolving, but we know that it involves the production of the chemokine, CXCL12, by the fibroblastic stromal cells, binding of this CXCL12 by pancreatic cancer cells, and exclusion of T cells from the vicinity of the cancer cells.  T cell exclusion, which also occurs in several types of human adenocarcinomas, causes antagonists of T cell checkpoints to be ineffective, despite the presence of cancer-specific CD8+ T cells.  This immune suppression is interrupted by administering AMD3100, an inhibitor of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, which leads to the rapid accumulation of T cells amongst cancer cells, thereby uncovering the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and eliminating cancer cells.  Since human pancreatic cancer has certain immunological characteristics of the mouse model, a phase 1 clinical trial of AMD3100 in patients with pancreatic cancer will be initiated in 2015.

The lab has also shown that when RNA polymerase II has transcribed a  of DNA, the RNA interference mechanism causes the enzyme to release its hold on the DNA and fall away. This allows the replication fork to progress smoothly and the DNA strands to be copied;histone-modifying proteins, which follow right along, establish heterochromatin. Martienssen’s group also continues to work on problems related to the creation of plant-based biofuels. This year, as part of a collaborative project to generate a high-quality full genome map of the oil palm plant, Martienssen and his colleagues identified a single gene that controls the yield of oil palm trees.

Through innovative use of a technique called “chromosome engineering,” the Mills group discovered that one of the most common genetic alterations in autism—deletion of a 27-gene cluster on chromosome 16—causes autism-like features in mice. These autism-like movement impairments can be identified just days after birth, suggesting that these features could be used to diagnose autism. Mills has also used chromosome engineering to identify a tumor suppressor gene that had eluded investigators for three decades. The gene, called Chd5, was shown by Mills to regulate an extensive cancer-preventing network. This year, the Mills lab uncovered how Chd5 acts as a tumor suppressor: It binds to a protein found within chromatin to turn specific genes on or off, halting cancer progression. The epigenetic role of Chd5 in development, cancer, and stem-cell maintenance is currently being investigated. The Mills lab is also studying p63 proteins, which regulate development, tumorigenesis, cellular senescence, and aging in vivo. They succeeded in halting the growth of malignant tumors by turning on production of one of the proteins encoded by the p63 gene, called TAp63. TAp63 also exerts other protective effects. This year, the Mills lab generated a mouse model which allowed them to find that TAp63 is required to prevent a genetic disorder, known as EEC (ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia cleft lip/palate syndrome), which is characterized by a cleft palate and major deformities of the skin and limbs in infants.

This occurs in 15%–20% of patients, the great majority of whom, within 1–3 years, develop resistance. Various mutations have been implicated in about half of resistant patients. Sordella and colleagues have discovered a new resistance mechanism in a subpopulation of NSCLC cells that are intrinsically resistant to Tarceva. These tumor cells were observed to secrete elevated amounts of a growth factor called transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which in turn increases secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an immune signaling molecule. Significantly, these effects were independent of the EGFR pathway. The team therefore hypothesizes that inflammation is one of the factors that can render a tumor cell resistant to treatment with Tarceva.

The lab’s analyses of Drosophila NF1 mutants have revealed how expression of the mutant gene affects a pathway crucial for learning and memory formation. The NF1 gene and a gene called corkscrew, implicated in NS, share a biochemical pathway. Recently, the lab succeeded in linking changes in this pathway due to specific genetic defects in NS with long-term memory deficiencies. In fly models, they discovered the molecular underpinnings of the “spacing effect”— the fact that memory is improved when learning sessions are spaced out between rest intervals. Zhong’s team also has succeeded in reversing memory deficits in mutant flies, work suggesting longer resting intervals for NS patients might reverse their memory deficits. They also identified a means of reversing memory loss in fruit flies while suppressing brain plaques similar to those implicated in Alzheimer’s disease by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, a pathway commonly targeted in cancer. Separately, having discovered that memory decay is an active process, regulated by the Rac protein, the team has proposed that Rac’s role in erasing memory is related to its influence on downstream cytoskeleton remodeling agents.

Of particular interest is how these “reproductive phase transitions” have contributed to the evolution of diverse inflorescence branching patterns in tomato’s larger Solanaceae family, which includes plants that make just one flower, such as pepper and petunia, in each inflorescence, to plants whose inflorescences produce dozens of branches and hundreds of flowers, such as many wild species of tomato. Using a combination of genetic, genomic, and molecular approaches, Lippman is dissecting the gene networks that are responsible for the variation in inflorescence branching found in nature. He hopes to leverage these discoveries to improve crop yields. Already, his work on genes that are responsible for the production and activity of a universal flowering hormone known as florigen has resulted in novel approaches to fi ne-tune plant architecture and flower production, boosting yield beyond leading commercial varieties. To continue hunting for new genes, Lippman has adopted a systems-biology approach and next-generation sequencing technology to capture those genes that are active as stem cells mature from a vegetative to a reproductive state. Nearly 4000 genes were found to reflect the existence of a “maturation clock,” and one of the clock genes known as Terminating Flower acts as a key regulator to maintain a progressive pace to flowering—which in turn, dictates how many flowers are produced on each tomato inflorescence.

Shea and colleagues have examined how emotion and arousal enable mice, via their olfactory systems, to store memories of other individuals and of related social signals. The team has exploited the intimate relationship between memory and emotion to effectively create memories in anesthetized mice, allowing them unprecedented access to neurobiological processes that typically only occur during behavior. The lab has been making a detailed analysis of the changes in neural connections that underlie odor memory. The team is particularly focused on an enigmatic cell type (granule cells or GCs) that has long been hypothesized to be crucial for memories, but has resisted direct study.

The results show unexpectedly complex population dynamics among the GCs that were independently predicted by a model of odor learning developed in Alexei Koulakov’s lab.

More broadly, Dr.Chu has interests in B cell biology, particularly B cell maturation and development and its relationship to disease and autoimmunity. Dr. Chu’s laboratory has found that the ability of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) of CLL cells to bind antigen correlates with patient outcome. This key involvement of the B cell antigen receptor in CLL has been confirmed by several recent successful clinical trials blocking the BCR signaling pathway, which leads to CLL disease reduction. Dr. Chu’s laboratory is dedicated to research to finding better diagnostic tools and the ultimate cure for CLL patients. CLL is a cancer, or uncontrolled expansion, of a cell in the immune system called a B lymphocyte. Normally, B cells produce antibodies to fight off infections that invade the body. Individual B cells generally do not live long and typically do not make up a large fraction of cells found in the blood. However, in CLL, a single B cell abnormally begins to grow uncontrollably, resulting in population of identical B cells derived from this original cell, or clonal expansion. This CLL clone grows and expands until it eventually makes up the majority of white blood cells found in the blood. Because CLL is clonal, all the leukemic cells make the same antibody molecule. The sequence of the CLL antibody molecule can be determined and characterized by the degree of mutation. Surprisingly, CLL patients with an unmutated (less than or equal to 2%) antibody sequence tend to have a worse clinical outcome. This dependence of clinical outcome on mutation suggests that an unidentified molecule that binds to the antibody may be important to the outcome of this disease. Furthermore, each B cell normally produces a single antibody molecule that is created via a DNA recombination and mutation process, resulting in a unique antibody that is extremely unlikely to be found in another person. However, in CLL, about 30% of patients share very similar antibody sequences! This is exceedingly improbable by random chance, and therefore suggests that a common molecule(s) binds the CLL antibodies of multiple CLL patients. The goal of the proposed research is to improve the evaluation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with regard to the course of their disease. Both the level of IGHV mutation and the percentage of CD38+ cells in a CLL clone predict clinical outcome in ~75-80% patients. Dr. Chu’s team plans to improve the accuracy of prediction of CLL patient outcome by assessing hypervariable gene expression by CLL cells in combination with IGHV and CD38 measurements.

In the past several years, Dr. Guo’s team uncovered the mechanism by which IL-4 amplifies BCR-initiated B cell activation. They found that IL-4 up-regulates Igaa and Igb expression, which leads to elevated surface IgM expression. Therefore, immune response is amplified in germinal center microenvironment. IL-4 expression is associated with autoimmune disease and tumor. Their future work will focus on dissecting the roles of IL-4 in the regulation of lupus, autoimmune disease and lymphoma such as B-CLL. Ostepontin (Opn) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is implicated in multiple diseases. Multiple cell types secrete Opn upon activation. Naïve B2 cells do not express Opn even after BCR stimulation. His group found for the first time that B2 cells acquire the ability to secrete Opn after encountering T cell help such as IL-4. Elevated Opn expression is closely associated with autoimmune diseases. They found that Opn over-expressing B2 cells are hyperresponsive to CpG stimulation. Furthermore, old Opn transgenic mice (Ig promoter) spontaneously secrete anti-dsDNA IgM and IgG antibodies. Thus, B2 cell-derived Opn has a potential role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. Their future work will focus on elucidating the mechanism by which B cell-derived Opn influence the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. B1 cells are the major source for natural IgM antibody, which is critical for maintaining homeostasis and preventing microbial invasion. PD-L2+ B1 cells are enriched with autoreactive specificities and secrete autoreactive natural IgM antibody, which facilitates clearance of autoantigens. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms that govern B1 cell development and function is another research interest in his laboratory.", "http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/benchang-guo-phd/", "", "Leukemia;Lymphoma", "Researcher", "", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "", "1211;1587", "115544", ""],

She holds a joint appointment as professor in the departments of medicine and molecular medicine at Hofstra-North Shore LIJ School of Medicine. Dr. Sherry received her bachelor’s degree from Smith College and her doctoral degree from Brandeis University. Early in her career, while a postdoctoral fellow at The Rockefeller University, Dr. Sherry pioneered a protein-based strategy to discover novel cytokines – immune regulatory proteins secreted by blood cells – that play a role in protecting the body against pathogens. Her work led to the discovery of three novel proteins (MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MIP-2) whose actions are critical for both host defense and normal immune system homeostasis. These were three of the founding members of the group of proteins now known as chemokines – a class of secreted proteins that regulate cell movement and serve as the “traffic cops” of the immune system. Dr. Sherry’s laboratory continues to investigate the biological roles of these molecules in the body’s response to bacterial and viral infections and cancer. Dr. Sherry is an international authority on chemokine biology and has authored more than 90 peer-reviewed publications in this field and has been an inventor or co-inventor on seven patents. Her research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and Concerned Parents for AIDS Research. Dr. Sherry’s laboratory has had a long-standing interest in the mechanisms that coordinate the innate immune response — the body’s first line of defense against invading pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites and tumors. Early work led to the discovery of a novel set of chemoattractant proteins secreted by cells in response to bacterial challenge, and the determination that those proteins were in fact members of a larger family of proteins (the chemokine family) that plays a critical role in host defense and immune system homeostasis.

As with other inflammatory cytokines, the team now recognizes that excessive production of these same chemokine proteins and/or dysregulation of chemokine receptor expression can have harmful consequences and contribute to disease-associated pathology. Their ongoing research goal is to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate chemokine and chemokine receptor responses in healthy individuals, and to identify how these pathways are dysregulated in sepsis, HIV infection and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Their studies will identify new therapeutic targets to restore immune function and improve clinical outcome in disease.Her research projects include: Chemokine Receptor Regulation in Inflammation, Infection, and Sepsis;Regulation of host antiviral β-chemokine responses in HIV-infected individuals;Role of the Microenvironment in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/barbara-sherry-phd/", "", "Leukemia", "Researcher", "", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "", "320;326;727;979", "7082;59742", ""],

Its site of action is thought to be the guanine residues in the DNA chain forming inter and intrastrand cross-links. Unfortunately, cancer cells which are initially often responsive, develop resistance, limiting its effectiveness. There have been many studies attempting to find specific markers for resistance to cisplatin, including genes in the AKT, ROS, 14-3-3 zeta, ER stress and cell cycle pathways. However, when a stable resistant ovarian cancer cell line was analyzed with cDNA microarrays followed by cDNA transfection of the candidate genes, an enzyme dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, (which has been previously implicated in the metabolic reduction and activation/inactivation of several xenobiotics) was found to produce cisplatin resistance. We showed that transfection or knockout of this enzyme from a whole series of tumor cell lines, including those derived from lung, cervical, testicular, ovarian primary tumors;resulted in significantly increased (transfection) or decreased (knockout) resistance to cisplatin. Recently, we have found that this enzyme is implicated in cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinomas, but not mesotheliomas nor small cell carcinomas. In addition, another enzyme which has previously been implicated in platinum resistance, (glutathione transferase pi) was found to be present in cell lines which do not contain dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (e.g. hematologic and lung mesothelioma cell lines). Knockdown of this enzyme resulted in sensitization of a whole series of lymphoma cell lines to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin-drugs that have been used successfully in previously-treated patients with refractory lymphomas. The ultimate aim of this work is to determine whether inhibitors to these two enzymes will sensititize resistant cells to platinum based chemotherapy.", "http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/henry-simpkins-phd-md/;https://www.northshorelij.com/find-care/find-a-doctor/pathology-hematology/dr-henry-simpkins-md-11366774", "", "Cervical;Lung;Lymphoma;Ovary;Testicular;Breast;Head & Neck", "Researcher", "", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "", "214;407;423;471", "", ""],

Kountz award for Clinical Excellence in surgery. His return to the North Shore-LIJ Health System was a homecoming of sorts since he completed his general surgical training at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 2003. During his surgical training, Dr. Soffer spent two additional years as a Research/Extracorporeal Life Support fellow at Columbia University. Dr Soffer has been an active researcher throughout his career with numerous basic science and clinical publications to his credit. His research interests focus on angiogenesis and metastasis in pediatric solid tumor models and the use of anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic therapies to achieve lasting tumor suppression. Dr Soffer has won awards for his research and has successfully completed several grants that have funded his work. He is the author of more than 35 peer reviewed publications, 5 book chapters, and many national and international presentations. He has mentored multiple surgical residents in his laboratory, several of whom have gone on to become academic pediatric surgeons. Dr Soffer is American Board of Surgery certified in both General and Pediatric Surgery. His clinical practice is confined to Pediatric Surgery and his special interests include complex neonatal surgery, pediatric minimal invasive surgery, and pediatric surgical oncology. Ewing Sarcoma is the second-most common bone and soft tissue malignancy of childhood. The long-term prognosis for patients with metastatic Ewing Sarcoma is poor, and more than two-thirds of these children will succumb to their disease within five years. Multi-agent chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, complemented by surgery and radiation for local control of the primary tumor site or isolated metastatic disease. Although these modalities may be successful for limited, local disease, metastatic Ewing Sarcoma continues to be a great challenge with few effective treatments. New therapeutic options are urgently needed to address these high-risk patients. Macrophages are phagocytic derivatives of circulating bone marrow-derived monocytes. Upon infiltration into tissues, macrophages serve a variety of homeostatic and immunoregulatory roles important to the adaptive and innate inflammatory responses. Similar to other immunoregulatory cells, macrophages exist in a spectrum of functional states, the extremes of which can be generally characterized by the pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Macrophages that infiltrate and subsequently comprise a substantial portion of the tumor microenvironment are termed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAM-induced malignant progression is reflected by a number of studies on various human tumor specimens that correlate overexpression of macrophage chemoattractants, as well as increased numbers of infiltrating macrophages, with worse prognoses. There is also increasing evidence that macrophages play an important role in establishing the “premetastatic niche,” altering the stromal environment at sites far from the primary tumor and enhancing extravasation and growth of metastatic cells. Few studies have examined the role of macrophages in Ewing Sarcoma, although some evidence suggests that TAMs may promote Ewing Sarcoma disease progression. CNI-1493, also known as semapimod, is a small molecule anti-inflammatory agent that has been shown to inhibit production of macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators without significantly affecting other cell lineage. Although the mechanism of action remains to be delineated, CNI-1493 has been deemed safe and well tolerated in humans, having completed a phase II clinical trial for Crohn’s disease without significant adverse side effects [41-44]. Given its safety profile, CNI-1493 has recently been identified as a possible TAM-targeting antitumor agent. In our lab we have discovered that CNI-1493 markedly decreases the incidence of invasive metastasis and tumor burden in a mouse model of Ewing Sarcoma, and that it suppresses M2 macrophage-stimulated tumor cell invasion and extravasation in vitro. We are also studying the relationship between metastases and the cyclooxygenase pathway focusing on the potential for commercially available COX-2 inhibitors, used as anti-inflammatory agents, as potential anti-metastatic agents. Our goal is to develop an up-front anti-metastatic regimen for pediatric solid tumors that have high metastatic potential which when coupled with surgical excision of the primary tumor and standard adjuvant therapies will lead to enhanced long term survival.", "http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/samuel-z-soffer-md/", "", "Sarcoma;Mets;Brain;CNS;Kidney", "Clinician, Researcher", "", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "", "240;570;572;708", "", ""],

After two years at Columbia University as a Senior Research Associate, Dr. Steinberg joined the Department of Otolaryngology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center where she began her studies of human papillomaviruses and their role in diseases of the head and neck, including recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and cancer. Those studies have been supported continuously by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 1983. Dr. Steinberg is the author or co-author of 93 peer-reviewed publications and 25 book chapters. Her important research has received a number of awards, including the Robert K. Match Distinguished Scientist Award, the Long Island Achiever in Science Award from the Long Island Center for Business and Professional Women, the Elliot Osserman Award from the Israel Cancer Research Fund, the Karl Storz Award from the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology, the Lorinda de Roulet Award for Excellence in Research, and the Israel Cancer Research Fund Award for Women of Excellence. Most recently, she served as President of the International Papillomavirus Society. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a large family of viruses that cause a wide range of benign and malignant tumors ranging from common skin warts and genital warts to cervical cancer and some cancers in the oral cavity. Nearly everyone is infected by HPVs, but most infections are latent (silent), with no evidence of disease. Dr. Steinberg’s research in the laboratory is primarily focused on diseases of the airway caused by HPVs. One of the diseases she studies is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a rare disease that affects both children and adults. The papillomas in RRP patients are benign, but the disease causes significant suffering and can even be fatal because the papillomas can block the airway. Surgical removal is the only approved treatment, but the papillomas often recur rapidly. In severe cases, surgery to clear the airway may be required as often as once a month. The papillomas are primarily located in the larynx, but approximately 17% of patients will have tracheal disease and 5% will have papillomas of the lung. There is no effective treatment for lung involvement, and the lung papillomas frequently convert to cancer. Improved treatments, based on better knowledge of the biology of the disease, are badly needed. HPVs also cause some head and neck cancers, especially tonsil cancers. Recent studies show that the cancers caused by HPVs are becoming much more common. Fortunately, those cancers usually respond well to treatment. Most of the research Dr. Steinberg does on RRP will be directly applicable to her studies of HPV-induced head and cancers as well. Promising avenues of research Dr. Steinberg and her team are following in their lab include the interactions between HPV and its target cells, the role of the immune system in controlling HPV-induced diseases, activation of latent HPV infection, a clinical trial of Celebrex as a treatment for RRP, studies on HPV-induced head and neck cancer, and studies of molecular mechanisms regulating metastasis of carcinomas and sarcomas.", "http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/bettie-m-steinberg-phd/", "", "Head & Neck;Sarcoma;Mets", "Researcher", "", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA", "", "1;2;3;241;243;253;570;572;683;792;1016;1339;1455;1668", "7946;8579;7110;7112", ""],
