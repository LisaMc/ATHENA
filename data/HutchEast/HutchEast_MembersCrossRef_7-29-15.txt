'Mickey' Atwal and colleagues are applying insights from the physical and computational sciences to the study of population genetics and human disease. The Atwal lab has modeled the process by which genetic variants, or alleles, have evolved in the last 100,000 years of human history. This has recently led to surprising insights about the role of p53, a master tumor suppressor gene, in female fertility and furthered our understanding of how complex gene networks evolve. The lab has analyzed the comparative genomics and physical organization of cancerrelated genes and their role in mediating tumorigenesis across numerous tissue types. Recently, they have begun to focus efforts on understanding cancer genome evolution on shorter time scales by analyzing nucleotide sequences from single cells.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Gurinder-Atwal.html; http://atwallab.cshl.edu/	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Population genetics; bioinformatics; cancer; stochastic processes; statistical mechanics; information theory	1157;1666;1667;1668;1669;1670;1671;1672;991;992;993;994;185;38

3	Camila Dos Santos	Dos Santos	Camila	PhD	Assistant Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Dos Santos Laboratory 	(516) 367-5042	dossanto@cshl.edu	Camila dos Santos’ laboratory studies the epigenetic regulation of normal and malignant mammary gland development, with an emphasis on the alterations brought by pregnancy. Significant changes mark the pre- and post-pubescence mammary developmental stages, but those associated with pregnancy have the greatest effect on cellular function, tissue reorganization, and breast cancer susceptibility. Her group has recently found that mammary glands react differently to a second pregnancy than they do to the first one, with associated changes in DNA methylation. These findings suggested that pregnancy changes the state of mammary cells, and these may permanently alter how they react to the next pregnancy. In addition, the dos Santos lab is exploring how the pregnancy-induced epigenetic changes might influence cell transformation and the risk of breast cancer. This research utilizes genomic and computational approaches to define the pre and post-pregnancy mammary epigenome. An additional objective of the dos Santos’ laboratory is to use functional genomics to discover novel transcriptional regulators that modulate mammary stem cell self-renewal, lineage specification, and cell transformation. The long-term objective of Camila’s group is to improve the notion of the mammary epigenome during normal development and use this information to gain insight into new preventive and curative strategies to target breast cancer.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Camila-Dos-Santos.html	NA	Breast	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Breast cancer, mammary gland development, stem cells, enhancer biology, gene regulation	1441;577;1203;669;1440		
4	Mikala Egeblad	Egeblad	Mikala	PhD	Associate Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Tumor Microenvironment / Egeblad Laboratory 	(516) 367-6852	egeblad@cshl.edu	Mikala Egeblad and colleagues study tumors and, in particular, the contributions of the microenvironment in which the cancer cells arise and live. Solid tumors are abnormally organized tissues that contain not only cancer cells, but also various stromal cell types and the extracellular matrix, and these latter components constitute the microenvironment. Communications between the different components of the tumor influence its growth, its response to therapy, and its ability to metastasize. Among the tumor-associated stromal cells, the lab’s main focus is on myeloid-derived immune cells, a diverse group of cells that can enhance angiogenesis and metastasis and suppress the cytotoxic immune response against tumors. Egeblad is interested in how different types of myeloid cells are recruited to tumors and how their behaviors—for example, their physical interactions with cancer cells and other immune cells—influence cancer progression, including metastasis. The Egeblad lab studies the importance of the myeloid cells using mouse models of breast and pancreatic cancer and real-time imaging of cells in tumors in live mice. This enables them to follow the behaviors of and the interactions between cancer and myeloid cells in tumors during progression or treatment. This technique was instrumental when the lab recently showed that cancer drug therapy can be boosted by altering components of the tumor microenvironments, specifically reducing either matrix metalloproteinases (enzymes secreted by myeloid cells) or chemokine receptors (signal receptors on myeloid cells). This year, the Egeblad lab collaborated with Scott Powers’ group to understand how normal cells surrounding a tumor promote cancer growth. They found that normal cells signal to tumors through multiple pathways, and blocking these signals together has the greatest effect on inhibiting tumor growth—offering a new strategy to fight cancer.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Mikala-Egeblad.html / http://egebladlab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Breast;Pancreas;Mets;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Tumor microenvironment; intravital imaging; tumor-associated myeloid cells; breast cancer	1415;1416;1417;1418;1419;1420;1421;1422;1423;1424;1425;1426;1427;145	6558;5755	
5	Grigori Enikolopov	Enikolopov	Grigori	PhD	Adjunct Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Enikolopov Laboratory 	(516) 367-8316	enikolop@cshl.edu	Grigori Enikolopov and colleagues study stem cells in the adult brain. They have generated several models to account for how stem cells give rise to progenitors and, ultimately, to neurons, and they are using these models to determine the targets of antidepressant therapies, to identify signaling pathways that control generation of new neurons, and to search for neuronal and neuroendocrine circuits involved in mood regulation. Recent experiments suggest a new model of how stem cells are regulated in the adult brain, with a focus on stem cells’ decision on whether to divide—and embark on a path of differentiation—or remain quiescent. This model explains why the number of new neurons decreases with advancing age and may lead to impairments in memory and depressed mood. It also explains why multiple brain trauma and prolonged neurodegenerative disease may lead to accelerated decrease of cognitive abilities. In other research, the team has identified stem cell targets of various therapies used for treating depression and developed a general platform to determine the effect of drugs and therapies and predict their action. The team is now focusing on the signaling landscape of neural stem cells and on their interaction with the surrounding niche. Enikolopov’s group is also focusing on other types of stem cells in the organism. Their latest discovery, with a team at Cornell University, relates to a new type of stem cell in the ovary that normally heals the ovarian tissue after an oocyte is released, but easily transforms to become malignant and generate tumors. The team is now using these discoveries to reveal how stem cells relate to neural and oncological disorders.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Grigori-Enikolopov.html	NA	Brain;Ovary	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Stem cell; neurogenesis; development; signal transduction	1387;1388;1389;1390;1391;1392;1393;1394;1395;1396;1397;1398;1399;1400;1401;1402;1403;1404;1405;1406;1407;1408;1409;1410;1411;1412;1413;1414;1386	40209	
6	Douglas Fearon	Fearon	Douglas	MD	Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Fearon Laboratory 	(516) 367-5420	dfearon@cshl.edu	The Fearon laboratory studies the interaction between cancer and the immune system.  Our underlying premise is that the tumor microenvironment is immune suppressive because cancer cells elicit responses characteristic of wound healing and tissue regeneration.  This approach has led to the finding that activated fibroblasts in the tumor stroma mediate immune suppression in several mouse models of cancer, including the autochthonous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the Tuveson lab.  Our understanding of the basis of immune suppression is evolving, but we know that it involves the production of the chemokine, CXCL12, by the fibroblastic stromal cells, binding of this CXCL12 by pancreatic cancer cells, and exclusion of T cells from the vicinity of the cancer cells.  T cell exclusion, which also occurs in several types of human adenocarcinomas, causes antagonists of T cell checkpoints to be ineffective, despite the presence of cancer-specific CD8+ T cells.  This immune suppression is interrupted by administering AMD3100, an inhibitor of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12, which leads to the rapid accumulation of T cells amongst cancer cells, thereby uncovering the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and eliminating cancer cells.  Since human pancreatic cancer has certain immunological characteristics of the mouse model, a phase 1 clinical trial of AMD3100 in patients with pancreatic cancer will be initiated in 2015.  Some of our next steps are to determine the biological process that causes cancer cells to express non-mutated, shared antigens, and the means by which dormant metastases escape immune elimination.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Douglas-Fearon.html	NA	Pancreas	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cancer immunology, pancreatic cancer, mouse models	1372;1373;1374;1375;1376;1377;1378;1379;1380;1381;1382;1383;1384;1385;144;1371		
7	Thomas Gingeras	Gingeras	Thomas	PhD	Professor & Head of Functional Genomics	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Functional Genomics / Gingeras Laboratory 	(516) 422-4105	gingeras@cshl.edu	Thomas Gingeras and colleagues study where and how functional information is stored in genomes. These efforts help explain the biological and clinical effects of disease-causing gene mutations in humans and other organisms. Gingeras is a leader of the ENCODE (ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) and the mouseENCODE and modENCODE (model genome ENCODE) projects of the National Institutes of Health. His research has altered our understanding of the traditional boundaries of genes, revealing that almost the entire lengths of genomes in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans can be transcribed into RNA (pervasive transcription) and that most RNA products made by a cell are not destined to be translated into proteins (noncoding, or ncRNAs). In fact, ncRNAs are proving to be involved in a variety of other important biological functions. Some have been shown to be critical components in the pre- and posttranscriptional and translational processes, as scaffolds upon which large protein complexes are assembled and as extracellular signals. The initial studies that led to these observations have been extended to cover the entire human genome. 	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Thomas-Gingeras.html / http://gingeraslab.cshl.edu/	NA	AnyStretch	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genome-wide organization of transcription and the functional roles of non-protein coding RNAs	1294;1295;1296;1297;1298;1299;1300;1301;1302;1303;1304;1305;1306;1307;1308;1309;1310;1311;1312;1313;1314;1315;1316;1317;1318;1319;1320;1321;1322;1323;1324;1325;1197;1198;1199;1200;1201	4557;7004	
8	Christopher Hammell	Hammell	Christopher	PhD	Assistant Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Hammell Laboratory 	(516) 367-5207	chammell@cshl.edu	Christopher Hammell’s lab is interested in understanding gene regulatory processes that give rise to robust phenotypes associated with normal development in animals (specifically, how the timing of developmental processes is controlled) as well as the alterations in these pathways that give rise to diseases such as cancer (as in the alterations in mitogenic pathways in melanoma). Hammell and colleagues approach this elemental problem by using a variety of model organisms and patient-derived cancer cell lines. To directly identify the components that function in controlling normal developmental timing, they use the small nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, applying forward and reverse genetic approaches. In contrast to the extreme robustness of cell-fate lineage in C. elegans, in which specification of developmental programs is hard-wired, mutations that alter conserved signaling pathways in melanoma create relatively plastic developmental landscapes that allow these lesions to become aggressive tumors. Notably, the gene regulatory architecture of melanoma cells allows them to acquire resistance to therapeutic agents. Hammell’s team is interested in epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to resistance, specifically dramatic changes in gene expression patterns and intracellular signaling pathways. They are performing high-throughput screens to identify cellular factors that allow these re-wiring events to occur, with the idea that these components would make ideal therapeutic targets to complement existing clinical strategies.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Christopher-Hammell.html	NA	Any;Melanoma	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Post-transcriptional gene regulation; control of animal developmental timing; RNA biology	1268;1269;1270;1195;1196

Hammell Laboratory 	(516) 367-5009	mhammell@cshl.edu	Molly Hammell is working to tackle this problem, known as “acquired resistance,” in melanoma. Her lab, in collaboration with the Wistar Institute, combines the power of systems-level, high-throughput data analysis with patient-derived tumor samples. Hammell has developed computational algorithms for the integration of multiple types of high-throughput sequencing data into gene regulatory circuits. She is now applying these methods to explore the global changes in gene regulation that enable melanoma cells to bypass inhibitors of the BRAF signaling pathway, including DNA mutations and epigenetic modifications. Her work will identify the most clinically relevant pathways of interest for additional therapeutic approaches to inhibit tumor growth in melanoma. In addition to her work on melanoma, Hammell is using her expertise in bioinformatics in collaboration with other members of the CSHL community (including Marja Timmermans, Josh Dubnau, and Greg Hannon) to understand gene regulation in diverse systems, from maize to Drosophila.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Molly-Hammell.html / http://hammelllab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Any;Melanoma	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Gene regulatory networks; integrated genomic analysis; bioinformatics; RNA biology; small RNAs	222;1264;1265;1266;1267;1192;1193;1194;1067;143;99		
10	Gregory Hannon	Hannon	Gregory	PhD	Professor & HHMI Investigator	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Hannon Laboratory 	(516) 367-8455	hannon@cshl.edu	Gregory Hannon is a pioneer in the study of RNA interference (RNAi), a process in which double-stranded RNA molecules induce gene silencing. Hannon and colleagues have elucidated key elements of the RNAi machinery. During the past several years, the Hannon lab has focused on the roles of small RNAs in germ cells, which tend to have the most elaborate set of small RNA pathways of any cell type. They have discovered an essential role for small RNAs, called Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), that are critical for proper oocyte development and guard the genome against transposable elements. This year, the lab conducted two screens, one in the fruit fly germline and another in somatic cells, to search for new components of the pathway that generates piRNAs. They identified dozens of genes that are required for piRNA production, offering insight into how germ cells ensure genomic integrity. The Hannon lab also strives to understand the biology of cancer cells, with a focus on breast and pancreatic cancer. They have led the way in using RNAi to study cancer biology and genetics, generating libraries of short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that have been widely applied in gene-silencing studies. These libraries can then be used to identify new therapeutic targets for specific disease subtypes. In addition, they are exploring the roles of small RNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors and using genetic approaches to understand the biology of resistance to currently used cancer therapies. Another research thrust of Hannon’s team exploits the power of next-generation sequencing to understand the biology of the mammalian genome. Their efforts range from the identification of new classes of small RNAs to understanding human evolution and diversity, including an emphasis on the evolution of the epigenome and its role in driving cell-fate specification.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Gregory-Hannon.html / http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/	NA	Any;Breast;Pancreas	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		1156;1204;1205;1206;1207;1208;1209;1210;1211;1212;1213;1214;1215;1216;1217;1218;1219;1220;1221;1222;1223;1224;1225;1226;1227;1228;1229;1230;1231;1232;1233;1234;1235;1236;1237;1238;1239;1240;1241;1242;1243;1244;1245;1246;1247;1248;1249;1250;1251;1252;1253;577;1203;1202;1197;1198;1199;1200;1201;1195;1196;1192;1193;1194;1063;1064;1065;1066;1190;1191;669;1440;1189;398;197	13106;9004;62534;101846;6557;12062;5754;5753;106035;148507;27;6554;5751;6556;64459;35612

12	Leemor Joshua-Tor	Joshua-Tor	Leemor	PhD	Professor & HHMI Investigator	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Joshua-Tor Laboratory 	(516) 367-8821	leemor@cshl.edu	In Leemor Joshua-Tor’s lab, researchers study the molecular basis of nucleic acid regulatory processes using the tools of structural biology and biochemistry. One such regulatory process is RNA interference (RNAi), in which a small double-stranded RNA triggers gene silencing. Joshua-Tor and her team offered critical insight when they solved the crystal structure of the Argonaute protein and identified it as the long-sought Slicer. They then went on to explore the mechanism of the slicing event. The structure of human Argonaute 2 (hAgo2) bound to a microRNA (miRNA) guide allowed Joshua-Tor and her colleagues to understand how mRNA is cleaved during RNAi. This year, members of the Joshua-Tor lab explored the function of a very similar protein, called Argonaute 1, that has no slicing ability, even though it is almost identical in structure to the slicing hAgo2. Using biochemical methods and mutational analysis, they were able to identify key parts of the protein that are required for slicing activity. The lab also studies the generation of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which serve to protect the genome of germ cells. With colleagues in the Hannon lab, Joshua-Tor’s team also determined the structure and function of Zucchini, a key nuclease in the initial generation of piRNAs in fruit flies. In other work, the lab is exploring the mechanisms of heterochromatin formation and gene silencing through the study of a protein complex called RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing (RITS). Joshua-Tor is also well known for her work on the E1 helicase enzyme, which acts to unwind DNA strands during the DNA replication process.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Leemor-Joshua-Tor.html / http://joshua-torlab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	AnyStretch	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Structural biology; nucleic acid regulation; RNAi; molecular recognition; X-ray crystallography	692;1068;1069;1070;1071;1072;1073;1074;1063;1064;1065;1066;1067;358;183;184	65094;74075;46724	
13	Justin Kinney	Kinney	Justin	PhD	Assistant Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Quantitative Biology / Kinney Laboratory	(516) 367-5230	jkinney@cshl.edu	Justin Kinney completed his PhD in Physics at Princeton University in 2008 and began his term as a Quantitative Biology Fellow in 2010. His research focuses on developing next-generation DNA sequencing as a tool for dissecting the structure and function of large macromolecular complexes. Of particular interest to his lab is the biophysical basis of transcriptional regulation—how simple interactions between proteins and DNA allow promoters and enhancers to modulate genes in response to physiological signals. In 2010, Kinney and colleagues published a paper demonstrating Sort-Seq, a novel sequencing-based method that can measure the functional activity of hundreds of thousands of slightly mutated versions of a specific DNA sequence of interest. Using a novel information-theoretic analysis of the resulting data, Kinney et al. were able to quantitatively measure, in living cells, the protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions controlling mRNA transcription at a chosen promoter. Kinney continues to develop this approach using a combination of theory, computation, and experiment. From a biological standpoint, Sort-Seq allows researchers to investigate important but previously inaccessible biological systems. Kinney’s lab is currently using Sort-Seq to address open problems in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and immunology. These experiments also present new challenges for the field of machine learning, and a substantial fraction of Kinney’s efforts are devoted to addressing the theoretical and computational problems relevant to the analysis of Sort-Seq data.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Justin-Kinney.html / http://kinneylab.wikis.cshl.edu/	NA	AnyStretch	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Sequence-function relationships; machine learning; biophysics; transcriptional regulation	995;996;997;998;999;991;992;993;994;340;115;116

In particular, they study splicing in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disease that is the leading genetic cause of death in infants. In SMA, a gene called SMN2 is spliced incorrectly, making it only partially functional. The Krainer lab is able to correct this defect using a potentially powerful therapeutic approach. It is possible to stimulate protein production by altering mRNA splicing through the introduction of chemically modified pieces of RNA called antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) into the spinal cords of mice. Previously, using ASOs in mice carrying a transgene of human SMN2, they developed a model for SMA using a technique they called TSUNAMI (shorthand for targeting splicing using negative ASOs to model illness). This year, they used the method to develop a mouse model for adult onset SMA, and they are currently working to develop models for the study of other diseases caused by splicing defects, including familial dysautonomia. The Krainer lab has also worked to shed light on the role of splicing proteins in cancer. They have found that the splicing factor SRSF1 functions as an oncogene stimulating the proliferation of immortal cells. This year, they were surprised to find that SRSF1 can actually stop cell growth by stabilizing a powerful tumor suppressor protein, called p53—suggesting that the cell is responding to the aberrant SRSF1 activity. This discovery offers insight into how tumors arise and the pathways that lead to transformation.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Adrian-R-Krainer.html	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Posttranscriptional control of gene expression; pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms, fidelity and genetic diseases; alternative splicing; RNA-protein interactions; cancer	899;900;901;902;903;904;905;906;907;908;909;910;911;912;913;914;915;916;917;918;919;920;921;922;923;924;925;926;927;928;929;930;931;932;933;934;935;936;898;573;397	42699;5749;7;6552;81448	
15	Alexander Krasnitz	Krasnitz	Alexander	PhD	Associate Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Krasnitz Laboratory 	(516) 367-6863	krasnitz@cshl.edu	Alexander Krasnitz and colleagues use mathematical and statistical tools to discover key genetic elements involved in cancer and to understand how cancer cells evolve. Array-based comparative genome hybridization, a technique honed in the Wigler lab, and, more recently, sequencing experiments, have revealed subtle patterns of frequent and widespread aberration in cancer genomes. Krasnitz hypothesizes that recurrent, aberrant genomic loci observed in a range of cancer types are under selection and therefore are enriched in important cancer genes. He has developed a novel, comprehensive methodology to discover such “cores” and has used it to analyze multiple genome data sets in breast, liver, ovarian, and prostate cancer. The results have been shared with cancer biology labs across CSHL, and they have been a key enabling agent of functional studies using mouse models and RNA interference. Krasnitz has begun to apply these novel statistical tools to the latest generation of experimental data, which have characterized tumor samples down to the level of single cells. By interpreting single-cell genomes, he and colleagues seek to learn how specific tumors evolve and how cancer cells migrate to invade adjacent tissues and metastasize. 	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Alexander-Krasnitz.html	NA	Breast;Liver;Ovary;Prostate;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genomics of cancer; machine learning for biology; inference from noisy biological datal; large-scale numerical computing	895;896;897;571;572;339;34;49;50;894;40		
16	Je H. Lee	Lee	Je H.	MD, PhD	Assistant Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Lee Laboratory	(516) 367-5421	jlee@cshl.edu	The Lee Lab studies how cells interact with their microenvironment to regulate gene expression during development. Single cell heterogeneity in gene expression can result from spatial differences in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Such differences contribute to stochastic evolution of tumor cells as well as morphogenesis during normal development. However, the spatial control of gene expression in complex tissues, embryos, or tumors remains poorly understood, because most genome-wide studies sample bulk tissues or dissociated single cells. We have recently developed a method to sequence RNA molecules directly within single cells and tissues using sub-cellular resolution imaging, and we demonstrated subtle differences in cell-cell/ECM signaling and gene expression genome-wide in situ. By clustering transcripts into functionally or morphological discrete regions, we find many unique spatial markers and signaling pathways. My lab focuses on the role of non-coding RNA in chromatin remodeling and tumor progression using mouse and organoid models of human cancer. We use in situ sequencing, cell lineage tracing, and single-cell profiling to understand how non-coding RNA affects tumor cell evolution in their native context. Our long-term goal is to develop better tumor classification tools and anti-cancer therapeutics using our understanding of the tumor microenvironment.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Je-H-Lee.html	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Single-cell, in situ RNA-seq, non-coding RNA, spatial genomics, cancer microenvironment	858;859;860

Richard McCombie and colleagues have led to the introduction and optimization of novel methods of high-throughput genome sequencing. His team has made it possible to catalog variation among individual organisms in a way that would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. They have brought online a new generation of Illumina sequencers and optimized their function to a level at which eight to 10 trillion DNA bases can be sequenced in a month. McCombie’s team has been involved in international efforts culminating in genome sequences for maize, rice, bread wheat—three of the world’s most important food crops. They have also had an important role in projects to sequence the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana (the first plant genome sequence), the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, as well as the human genome and other important genomes. McCombie’s group is currently involved in several important projects to resequence genes in patient samples that are of special interest to human health, including DISC1 (a strong candidate gene for schizophrenia), looking for genetic variants implicated in bipolar illness and major recurrent depression.  They are also looking for genes, that contribute to cancer progression using whole genome sequencing or a method called exome sequencing which they developed with Greg Hannon to look at mutations in the regions of the genome that code for proteins.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Richard-W-McCombie.html / http://mccombielab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genomics of psychiatric disorders; genomics of cancer; computational genomics; plant genomics	57;58;666;670;671;672;673;674;675;676;677;678;679;680;681;682;683;684;685;686;687;689;690;691;1190;1191;669;898;1326;1143;59;1067;472;667;668;475;40;37	87992;102068

Through innovative use of a technique called “chromosome engineering,” the Mills group discovered that one of the most common genetic alterations in autism—deletion of a 27-gene cluster on chromosome 16—causes autism-like features in mice. These autism-like movement impairments can be identified just days after birth, suggesting that these features could be used to diagnose autism. Mills has also used chromosome engineering to identify a tumor suppressor gene that had eluded investigators for three decades. The gene, called Chd5, was shown by Mills to regulate an extensive cancer-preventing network. This year, the Mills lab uncovered how Chd5 acts as a tumor suppressor: It binds to a protein found within chromatin to turn specific genes on or off, halting cancer progression. The epigenetic role of Chd5 in development, cancer, and stem-cell maintenance is currently being investigated. The Mills lab is also studying p63 proteins, which regulate development, tumorigenesis, cellular senescence, and aging in vivo. They succeeded in halting the growth of malignant tumors by turning on production of one of the proteins encoded by the p63 gene, called TAp63. TAp63 also exerts other protective effects. This year, the Mills lab generated a mouse model which allowed them to find that TAp63 is required to prevent a genetic disorder, known as EEC (ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia cleft lip/palate syndrome), which is characterized by a cleft palate and major deformities of the skin and limbs in infants. In addition, they recently discovered that a different version of p63, called ΔNp63, reprograms stem cells of the skin to cause carcinoma development—the most prevalent form of human cancer. Modulation of these proteins may offer new ways to treat human malignancies in the future.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Alea-A-Mills.html	NA	Skin;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cancer; development; aging; senescence; epigenetics	649;650;651;652;653;654;655;656;657;658;659;660;1067;1386;39	18332;127383;148056;190997

These are fundamental tools for proteomics, and they are vital in many fields of biological investigation. Proteins and peptides are typically analyzed via mass spectrometry, a method that involves fragmenting samples by colliding them with gas atoms in a vacuum. Masses of the resulting fragments are measured, and computer algorithms match the results with known or predicted molecules whose amino acid sequences are either known or inferred. Pappin has developed search engines for mass spectrometry data that enable investigators to sift hundreds of thousands of experimental spectra at a time for database matches. He also seeks to reduce sample complexity via an approach he calls chemical sorting. This includes the use of chelation to enrich phosphopeptides from the total peptide pool and the use of specific affinity-tagged small-molecule inhibitors to segregate classes of kinases or phosphatases for more specific mass spectroscopic analysis.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Darryl-Pappin.html	NA	AnyStretch	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Proteomics, mass spectrometry, protein chemistry	574;1440;573;571;572;198;199;200;197;183;184;143;142;114	29528

They also use whole-genome technologies to guide development of novel cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Using DNA copy number analysis, the Powers group pinpoints novel amplified oncogenes and then applies functional studies to address the mechanisms by which they are implicated in oncogenesis. They have successfully applied this approach in breast, liver, colon, and lung cancers. Powers has also had an important role in the development of a distinctive CSHL approach to functional study of cancer genes. Called integrative oncogenomics, it is a rapid, large-scale screen for genes that are deleted or amplified in human cancers and suspected of being tumor suppressors, in the case of deletions, or oncogenes, in the case of amplifications.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Scott-Powers.html	NA	Breast;Colorectal;Liver;Lung;Any	Research Scientist	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		1189	148532;9006;6559;168409;5756;124648

These methods have been used to reconstruct the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms, probe sequence variations, and explore a host of biological features across the tree of life. Recent improvements in sequencing technologies are challenging our capacity to store and analyze the huge volume of DNA sequence data being generated. Consequently, Schatz is particularly interested in capitalizing on the latest advances in distributed and parallel computing, especially cloud computing technologies, to advance the state of the art in bioinformatics and genomics.

Raffaella Sordella and colleagues study why cells in certain cancers are responsive to the inhibition of one particular gene or gene product. Why, for instance, do non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells that have a particular mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond dramatically to its inhibition by the drug Tarceva? This occurs in 15%–20% of patients, the great majority of whom, within 1–3 years, develop resistance. Various mutations have been implicated in about half of resistant patients. Sordella and colleagues have discovered a new resistance mechanism in a subpopulation of NSCLC cells that are intrinsically resistant to Tarceva. These tumor cells were observed to secrete elevated amounts of a growth factor called transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which in turn increases secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an immune signaling molecule. Significantly, these effects were independent of the EGFR pathway. The team therefore hypothesizes that inflammation is one of the factors that can render a tumor cell resistant to treatment with Tarceva. In other work, Sordella collaborates with the Krainer lab to study whether alternative splicing has a role in the failure of p53-mediated senescence to halt oncogenesis in certain lung cancers.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Raffaella-Sordella.html	NA	Lung;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Molecular therapeutics; signal transduction	399;400;401;402;403;404;405;398;397;182

Spector’s laboratory studies the spatial organization and regulation of gene expression. Their recent studies demonstrated an increase in random monoallelic gene expression upon the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to neural progenitor cells (NPCs). These data support a model where stochastic gene regulation during differentiation results in monoallelic gene expression, and for some genes, the cell is able to compensate transcriptionally to maintain the required transcriptional output of these genes. Therefore, random monoallelic gene expression exemplifies the stochastic and plastic nature of gene expression in single cells. In addition, the Spector lab is characterizing long nuclear retained noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that exhibit altered levels of expression as mESCs transition from the pluripotent state to NPCs, and they are studying lncRNAs that are misregulated in cancer. Their efforts have focused on Malat1 lncRNA, which is one of the most abundant noncoding RNAs. The Spector lab previously identified a novel mechanism of 3′-end processing of this RNA. Current studies have revealed that altered levels of Malat1 lncRNA impact breast cancer initiation and progression. Studies are currently under way to elucidate the mechanism of action of this abundant nuclear retained lncRNA.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/David-Spector.html / http://spectorlab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Breast;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cell biology; gene expression; nuclear structure; microscopy; non-coding RNAs	374;375;376;377;378;379;380;381;382;383;384;385;386;387;388;389;390;391;392;393;394;395;396;35	42694;6553;5750

Papillomaviruses are a large viral family that induces cell proliferation at the site of infection, usually giving rise to benign tumors. But certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) generate tumors that progress toward malignancy. Among these are HPVs that cause most cervical cancers.

PhD	President & CFO, Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Stillman Laboratory 	(516) 367-8383	stillman@cshl.edu	Bruce Stillman’s lab studies the process by which DNA is copied within cells before they divide in two. Working with yeast and human cells, Stillman and colleagues have identified many of the cellular proteins that function at the DNA replication fork during the S phase, the portion of the cell-division cycle when DNA synthesis occurs. Among these proteins are those that facilitate the assembly of chromatin, the protein–DNA complexes that form the chromosomes. Current research focuses on the mechanism that initiates the entire process of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. At the heart of this mechanism is a protein that binds to “start” sites on the chromosomes, called the Origin Recognition Complex, ORC. The Stillman lab is part of an ongoing collaboration that determined the cryo-EM structure of ORC proteins in complex with a group of proteins, called a helicase, that unwind DNA during replication. These images offer molecular insights into how the helicase is loaded onto DNA. Stillman’s research also focuses on the process by which duplicated chromosomes are segregated during mitosis. They found ORC at centrosomes and centromeres, structures that orchestrate chromosome separation during mitosis. At centromeres, ORC subunits monitor the attachment of duplicated chromosomes to the mitotic spindle that pulls the chromosomes apart when they are correctly aligned. Stillman’s team has discovered that mutations in the Orc1 protein alter the ability of ORC to regulate both DNA replication and centrosome duplication. These mutations have been linked to Meier–Gorlin syndrome, a condition that results in people with extreme dwarfism and small brain size, but normal intelligence.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Bruce-Stillman.html / http://stillmanlab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cancer; cell cycle; DNA replication; chromatin assembly; biochemistry; yeast genetics	341;342;343;344;345;346;347;348;349;350;351;352;353;354;355;356;357;340;339;338	45508;45436;8735;8736;8737;8738;8739;8740;8741;8743;8744;8745;8746;8748;8749;8750;8751;25;6551;5748

Disruption of PTP function is a cause of major human diseases, and several of the PTPs are potential therapeutic targets for such diseases. Tonks’ group seeks to fully characterize the PTP family, understanding how PTP activity is controlled and how PTPs modify signaling pathways. In addition, they are working to determine how those pathways are abrogated in serious illnesses, including cancer, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease. The overall goal is to identify new targets and strategies for therapeutic intervention in human disease. Tonks and colleagues have defined new roles for PTPs in regulating signaling events in breast cancer, identifying three PTPs as novel potential tumor suppressors. They have characterized the regulation of PTP1B by reversible oxidation, demonstrating that it is regulated by covalent modification of the active site by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) under conditions of ER stress that are linked to protein-folding-related pathologies, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. In addition, they have generated recombinant antibodies that selectively recognize the oxidized conformation of PTP1B; these antibodies display the ability to promote insulin signaling in cells and suggest novel approaches to therapy for diabetes. Finally, they have also discovered a novel mechanism for allosteric regulation of PTP1B activity, offering the possibility of developing small-molecule drugs that could inhibit the phosphatase and thereby modulate signaling by insulin and the oncoprotein tyrosine kinase HER2, potentially offering new ways to treat insulin resistance in type-2 diabetes and breast cancer.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Nicholas-Tonks.html	NA	Breast;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Posttranslational modification; phosphorylation; phosphatases; signal transduction; protein structure and function	201;202;203;204;205;206;207;208;209;210;211;212;213;214;215;216;217;218;219;220;198;199;200;197;181;100	53840;55989	
30	Lloyd Trotman	Trotman	Lloyd	PhD	Associate Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Trotman Laboratory 	(516) 367-5054	trotman@cshl.edu	Lloyd Trotman’s recent research path begins at his discovery some years ago that the loss of a single copy of a master tumor suppressing gene called PTEN is sufficient to permit tumors to develop in animal models of prostate cancer. His team later found that complete loss of PTEN paradoxically triggers senescence, an arrested state that delays or blocks cancer development in affected cells. These findings explained why many patients only display partial loss of this tumor suppressor when diagnosed with prostate cancer. Now the team is researching ways to restore the PTEN protein levels in these patients. This therapeutic approach could slow disease progression and thus greatly reduce the need for surgical removal of the prostate or similar drastic interventions that carry the risks of incontinence and impotence. Their second approach to combat prostate cancer is to model the lethal metastatic disease in genetically engineered mice. They are developing a novel approach that allows for quick generation and visualization of metastatic disease. The efficacy of existing and novel late-stage therapies, such as antihormonal therapy, can then be tested and optimized in these animals. At the same time, the Trotman lab is exploring the genome alterations associated with metastatic disease and with resistance to therapy. To this end, they use single- and multicell genome sequencing techniques developed at CSHL by Drs. Wigler and Hicks. 	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Lloyd-Trotman.html / http://trotmanlab.org/	NA	Prostate	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cancer modeling and treatment; Senescence and tumor progression; cancer visualization; PTEN regulation	20;186;187;188;189;190;191;192;193;194;196;185;183;184;182;181;142;195	137050

His team’s main focus is pancreatic cancer, a lethal malignancy that has eluded clinical solutions despite intensive study. The lab’s approaches at CSHL run the gamut from designing new model systems of disease to inventing new therapeutic and diagnostic platforms for rapid evaluation in preclinical and clinical settings. For example, they have adopted a new method of culturing tissue fragments indefinitely in cell culture, enabling deep analysis with genetic and pharmacological probes. In addition, therapeutic experiments in mouse models have revealed an important role of redox metabolism and stromal interactions on influencing therapeutic response. This year, they used the mouse model system to identify the mechanism of a promising drug treatment for pancreatic cancer. The lab found that using the drug in combination with more standard chemotherapeutic drugs stopped the tumor growth and lengthened life span for the mice, suggesting that the combination therapy may help overcome the drug resistance that is so commonly found in cancers. Tuveson’s lab also has a strong link to clinical trials locally and internationally, with confirmation in early-phase trials the ultimate goal. Collectively, their strategy in the preclinical and clinical arena is codified as the “Cancer Therapeutics Initiative,” and this initiative will provide these same approaches to the entire CSHL cancer community.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/David-Tuveson.html / http://tuvesonlab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Pancreas;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Pancreatic cancer, experimental therapeutics, diagnostics, mouse models, cancer genetics	146;147;148;149;150;151;152;153;154;155;156;157;158;159;160;161;162;163;164;165;166;167;168;169;170;171;143;142;145;144;1371;524	180944;190092	263
32	Christopher Vakoc	Vakoc	Christopher	MD, PhD	Assistant Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Vakoc Laboratory 	(516) 367-5045	vakoc@cshl.edu	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a particularly devastating and aggressive blood cancer that is currently incurable in 70% of patients. Research in Chris Vakoc’s lab seeks to understand this disease as well as others, such as lymphoid leukemias and epithelial tumors, by studying them at the level of genomic regulation. He is particularly interested in the proteins that regulate chromatin in the nucleus of the cell. To identify proteins involved in AML, which may also be targets for drug therapy, he deploys large-scale genetic screens using RNA interference (RNAi) as well as genetically engineered mouse models that display the hallmarks of human cancer. In collaboration with Jay Bradner at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Vakoc has shown that the small-molecule drug candidate JQ1 has potent anti-AML activity. It works by suppressing the protein Brd4, which is a critical regulator of the potent oncogene c-Myc. JQ1 is currently in clinical trials as a therapeutic strategy for AML. Vakoc’s team identified other chromatin regulators, including PRC2 and RNF20, that if blocked with small-molecule inhibitors may halt AML. This year, Vakoc’s lab gained new insights into the mechanism behind these drug targets when he found that Brd4 and other proteins required for AML bind to enhancers, short stretches of DNA more than a million bases away from the oncogene c-Myc. When Brd4 binds to the enhancer, it bends the DNA within the nucleus so that it touches the c-Myc region of the genome and activates it, causing cells to proliferate without restraint. Understanding how these proteins function in AML will allow researchers to design more effective and safer therapies to treat this intractable cancer.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Christopher-Vakoc.html / http://vakoclab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Chromatin; transcriptional regulation; acute myeloid leukemia; BET bromodomains; lysine methyltransferases	117;118;119;120;121;122;123;124;125;126;127;128;129;130;131;132;133;134;135;136;137;138;139;140;115;116;114;338;99;35	174793

They are particularly interested in Ras and Rho GTPases, which help control cellular growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Alterations affecting Ras and Rho functions are involved in cancer and various neurodevelopmental disorders. Van Aelst’s team has extended its prior study of mutations in a Rho-linked gene called oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1), part of an effort to connect the genetic abnormalities associated with mental retardation to biological processes that establish and modify the function of neuronal circuits. In addition to a role for OPHN1 in activity-driven glutamatergic synapse development, lab members have obtained evidence that OPHN1 has a critical role in mediating mGluR-LTD (long-term depression), a form of long-term synaptic plasticity, in CA1 hippocampal neurons. Their findings provide novel insight not only into the mechanism and function of mGluR-dependent LTD, but also into the cellular basis by which mutations in OPHN1 could contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in patients. Defects in cortical neurogenesis have been associated with cerebral malformations and disorders of cortical organization. The Van Aelst team discovered that interfering with the function of the Rho activator DOCK7 in neuronal progenitors in embryonic cerebral cortices results in an increase in the number of proliferating neuronal progenitors and defects in the genesis of neurons. In an extension of these studies, the Van Aelst team this year showed that DOCK7 has a central regulatory role in the process that determines how and when a radial glial cell progenitor “decides” to either proliferate, i.e., make more progenitor cells like itself, or give rise to cells that will mature, or “differentiate,” into pyramidal neurons. These lines of research provide novel insight into mechanisms that coordinate the maintenance of the neural progenitor pool and neurogenesis.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Linda-Van-Aelst.html	NA	Brain;Lung	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Signal transduction; Ras and Rho proteins; tumorigenesis; neuronal development	101;102;103;104;105;106;107;108;109;110;111;112;113;100;99	135053;82808;82266

The Wigler lab studies human cancer and the contribution of new mutation to genetic disorders. The cancer effort (with James Hicks, Alex Krasnitz, and Lloyd Trotman) focuses on breast and prostate cancers. It involves collaborative clinical studies to discover mutational patterns predicting treatment response and outcome and the development of diagnostics to detect cancer cells in bodily fluids such as blood and urine. The major tools are single-cell DNA and RNA analysis. The single-cell methods, which are in development, are also being applied to problems in neurobiology (with Josh Huang and Pavel Osten) to characterize neuronal subtypes, somatic mutation, and monoallelic expression. The Wigler lab’s genetic efforts are a collaboration with Ivan Iossifov and Dan Levy, and this team focuses on determining the role of new mutations in pediatric disorders. In a large-scale population sequencing project with W. Richard McCombie and the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University in St. Louis, and supported by the Simons Foundation, the team has proven the contribution of this mechanism to autism. The work further suggests a relationship between the mutational targets in autism and the process of neuroplasticity that lies at the heart of learning. Smaller-scale population studies of congenital heart disease and pediatric cancer (collaborations with scientists at Columbia University and Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center, respectively) also point to new mutation as a causal factor in these disorders.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Michael-Wigler.html	NA	Breast;Prostate;Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Human genetic disorders; population genetics; cancer genomics	51;52;53;54;55;34;49;50;894;40;39;38;37;36;35;44;45;46;47;48;42;43;41	90028

Exploiting self-renewal mechanisms holds great promise for the development of cell-based and regenerative medical strategies and for prevention of the abnormal activation of self-renewal pathways that contribute to irregular cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. Our research centers on normal and malignant progenitor and stem cells in the blood-forming system, specifically early erythroid progenitors and leukemic stem cells. Thus far, we have utilized reverse genetics to uncover several critical genes regulating early erythroid progenitor self-renewal, a first step towards our understanding of this process. To expand the therapeutic impact of this work, we aim to comprehensively dissect self-renewal pathways to pinpoint potential drug targets, as well as employ high-throughput screening approaches to identify molecules and chemical compounds capable of triggering self-renewal and expansion of these progenitors. These findings will help treat a broad spectrum of unresponsive anemias associated with bone marrow failure disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome, and many major types of cancers. Our newfound knowledge of self-renewal in normal cells can also be applied to research of leukemic cells, a population of malignant cells whose self-renewal machinery has been hijacked. By identifying the mechanistic divergence between normal and malignant hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells, we seek to specifically inhibit self-renewal in leukemic cells as novel therapies for leukemias.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Lingbo-Zhang.html	NA	Leukemia;Lymphoma;Myeloma;Myelodysplastic Syndrome	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Although eerily similar in terms of their self-renewal capacity and distinct phenotypic plasticity, malignant glioma cells conspicuously lack the terminal differentiation traits possessed by their normal counterparts—neural progenitors. With the use of multiple approaches combining human cancer genomics, animal modeling, and stem cell biology, Zheng has unraveled the causal relationship between aberrant differentiation and ensuing gliomagenesis. Perhaps more importantly, his team has demonstrated that forced restoration of differentiation capacity within glioma cells can drastically attenuate their tumorigenic potential. This finding fits well with the team’s overall strategy, which is to target differentiation control pathways as a novel avenue for malignant glioma treatment. To this end, they have sought (1) to develop various animal models to recapitulate the human glioma pathogenesis and utilize them to trace and investigate in vivo tumor initiation/ progression and (2) to identify key pathways/players controlling normal and neoplastic neural progenitor cell renewal and fate determination.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Hongwu-Zheng.html	NA	Brain	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Malignant gliomagenesis; animal modeling; stem cell renewal/differentiation; genetic and epigenetic regulation	13;14;15;16;17;18;12		
42	Jesse Gillis	Gillis	Jesse	PhD	Assistant Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes		Computational Biology, Gillis Laboratory 	(516) 367-4041 	jgillis@cshl.edu	There has been a growing appreciation in recent years that gene function is frequently context-dependent, with a large part of that context provided by the activities of other genes. But trying to understand how genes interact to produce function is a hugely complicated problem and one that appears likely to become more so as genomic information becomes more detailed. Jesse Gillis and colleagues are computational biologists who are presently challenging an oft-taken approach to the problem in which the functions of genes are interpreted in the context of networks derived from gene association data. Such networks consist of millions of interactions across thousands of genes, derived from protein-binding assays, RNA coexpression analysis, and other sources. Historically, many attempts to understand gene function through networks have leveraged a biological principle known as “guilt by association.” It suggests that genes with related functions tend to share properties (e.g., physical interactions). In the past decade, this approach has been scaled up for application to large gene networks, becoming a favored way to grapple with the complex interdependencies of gene functions in the face of floods of genomics and proteomics data. Gillis’ work centers on identifying the limits of the approach and making fundamental improvements to its operation, as well as applying those improvements to neuropsychiatric gene network data.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Jesse-Gillis.html / http://gillislab.labsites.cshl.edu/	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Gene networks; gene function prediction; guilt by association; neuropsychiatric; hub genes; multifunctionality; computational genomics	1327;1328;1329;1330;1331;1332;1333;1334;1335;1336;1337;1338;1339;1340;1341;1342;1202;1326;338

Dan Levy’s group develops algorithms to identify these mutations from large, high-throughput data sets comprising thousands of nuclear families. After earlier working with high-resolution CGH arrays, Levy’s group now uses targeted sequence data. Levy has developed methods for identifying de novo mutations (i.e., those seen in a child but not in his or her parents) by simultaneously genotyping the entire family; the team is currently focused on building algorithms to detect copy-number variants and multiscale genomic rearrangements. Although their copy-number methods are based on “read” density, there are classes of mutations that require analysis at the level of the read. Thus, they are developing algorithms to identify insertions, deletions, inversions, transpositions, and other complex events. Other projects in the Levy lab include analysis of single-cell RNA, phylogenetic reconstruction from sparse data sets, and disentangling haplotypes from sperm and subgenomic sequence data.	http://www.cshl.edu/Faculty/Dan-Levy.html	NA	Any	Researcher	Cold Spring Harbor		NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Human genetics; mathematical modeling; algorithm development	59;475;40;37;44;45;46;47;48;42;43;41		
209	Seungtai Yoon	Yoon	Seungtai		Research Assistant Professor	Cold Spring Harbor	Yes					CNVs are regions of the genome that vary in the number of copies between individuals. These variants were once considered to be anomalies that occurred rarely among healthy individuals. As the result of a discovery by CSHL Professor Michael Wigler and Dr. Sebat in 2004, CNVs are now recognized as a major source of human genetic variation and methods for detecting CNVs have proven to be an effective approach for identifying genetic risk factors for disease. Genome sequencing technologies are improving at a rapid pace. The current challenge is to find ways to extract all of the genetic information from the data. One of the biggest challenges has been the detection of CNVs. Sebat, in collaboration with Seungtai Yoon of CSHL and  Kenny Ye, Ph.D., at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, developed a statistical method to estimate DNA copy number of a genomic region based on the number of sequences that map to that location (or “read depth”). When the genomes of multiple individuals are compared, regions that differ in copy number between individuals can be identified. The new method allows the detection of small structural variants that could not be detected using earlier microarray-based methods. This is significant because most of the CNVs the genome are less than 5000 nucleotides in length. The new method is also able to detect certain classes of CNVs that other sequencing-based approaches struggle with, particularly those located in complex genomic regions where rearrangements occur frequently. The development of this novel method is timely. The 1000 Genomes Project was launched in 2008, as an international effort to sequence the genomes of 2000 individuals across geographic and ethnic regions to catalog human genetic variation. Sebat’s team along with many other groups has contributed to the production and analysis of these data. This innovation improves the detection of structural variants from whole genome sequence data, which will lead to improved sensitivity to detect disease-causing CNVs.

Dr. Chiorazzi and his colleagues have demonstrated the following; CLL cells are responsive to signals from the internal microenvironment, in particular those delivered by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), leading to leukemic cell proliferation and maturation or death; BCR-induced signals are likely delivered by common self antigens and are mediated through sets of BCRs of remarkably similar amino acid structure; patients with CLL segregate into two subgroups based on BCR structure that differ dramatically in clinical outcome; CLL cells proliferate and die in vivo at rates higher than originally appreciated. These findings have led to the view that (auto)antigen drive is a promoting factor in the development and evolution of CLL and have been a pivotal in refining patient prognosis.	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/nicholas-chiorazzi-md/	NA	Leukemia	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		1509;1510;1511;1512;1513;1514;1515;1516;1517;1518;1519;1520;1521;1522;1523;1524;1525;1526;1504;1505;1506;1507;1508;1500;1501;1502;1503;1688;1685;1686;1690;1689;1687;1683;1684	81554;7073;7078;7107	252

More broadly, Dr.Chu has interests in B cell biology, particularly B cell maturation and development and its relationship to disease and autoimmunity. Dr. Chu’s laboratory has found that the ability of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) of CLL cells to bind antigen correlates with patient outcome. This key involvement of the B cell antigen receptor in CLL has been confirmed by several recent successful clinical trials blocking the BCR signaling pathway, which leads to CLL disease reduction. Dr. Chu’s laboratory is dedicated to research to finding better diagnostic tools and the ultimate cure for CLL patients. CLL is a cancer, or uncontrolled expansion, of a cell in the immune system called a B lymphocyte. Normally, B cells produce antibodies to fight off infections that invade the body. Individual B cells generally do not live long and typically do not make up a large fraction of cells found in the blood. However, in CLL, a single B cell abnormally begins to grow uncontrollably, resulting in population of identical B cells derived from this original cell, or clonal expansion. This CLL clone grows and expands until it eventually makes up the majority of white blood cells found in the blood. Because CLL is clonal, all the leukemic cells make the same antibody molecule. The sequence of the CLL antibody molecule can be determined and characterized by the degree of mutation. Surprisingly, CLL patients with an unmutated (less than or equal to 2%) antibody sequence tend to have a worse clinical outcome. This dependence of clinical outcome on mutation suggests that an unidentified molecule that binds to the antibody may be important to the outcome of this disease. Furthermore, each B cell normally produces a single antibody molecule that is created via a DNA recombination and mutation process, resulting in a unique antibody that is extremely unlikely to be found in another person. However, in CLL, about 30% of patients share very similar antibody sequences! This is exceedingly improbable by random chance, and therefore suggests that a common molecule(s) binds the CLL antibodies of multiple CLL patients. The goal of the proposed research is to improve the evaluation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with regard to the course of their disease. Both the level of IGHV mutation and the percentage of CD38+ cells in a CLL clone predict clinical outcome in ~75-80% patients. Dr. Chu’s team plans to improve the accuracy of prediction of CLL patient outcome by assessing hypervariable gene expression by CLL cells in combination with IGHV and CD38 measurements. 	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/charles-chiyuan-chu-md/	NA	Leukemia	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		1499;1504;1505;1506;1507;1508;1503;1688;1690;1689		
65	Benchang Guo	Guo	Benchang	PhD	Assistant Investigator, Head of Laboratory of B Cell Signaling (FIMR)	Feinstein Institute			B Cell Signaling	(516) 562-2573	bguo@nshs.edu	Optimal B cell activation is a prerequisite for an efficient immune response, which is initiated by antigen and enhanced by T cell help such as Tfh-derived cytokine IL-4. In the past several years, Dr. Guo’s team uncovered the mechanism by which IL-4 amplifies BCR-initiated B cell activation. They found that IL-4 up-regulates Igaa and Igb expression, which leads to elevated surface IgM expression. Therefore, immune response is amplified in germinal center microenvironment. IL-4 expression is associated with autoimmune disease and tumor. Their future work will focus on dissecting the roles of IL-4 in the regulation of lupus, autoimmune disease and lymphoma such as B-CLL. Ostepontin (Opn) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is implicated in multiple diseases. Multiple cell types secrete Opn upon activation. Naïve B2 cells do not express Opn even after BCR stimulation. His group found for the first time that B2 cells acquire the ability to secrete Opn after encountering T cell help such as IL-4. Elevated Opn expression is closely associated with autoimmune diseases. They found that Opn over-expressing B2 cells are hyperresponsive to CpG stimulation. Furthermore, old Opn transgenic mice (Ig promoter) spontaneously secrete anti-dsDNA IgM and IgG antibodies. Thus, B2 cell-derived Opn has a potential role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. Their future work will focus on elucidating the mechanism by which B cell-derived Opn influence the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. B1 cells are the major source for natural IgM antibody, which is critical for maintaining homeostasis and preventing microbial invasion. PD-L2+ B1 cells are enriched with autoreactive specificities and secrete autoreactive natural IgM antibody, which facilitates clearance of autoantigens. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms that govern B1 cell development and function is another research interest in his laboratory.	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/benchang-guo-phd/	NA	Leukemia;Lymphoma	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		1280;1281;1279

During his career, he has attempted to translate laboratory knowledge into relevant diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The group he currently leads is working with numerous collaborators to develop meaningful genotype-phenotype correlations. This “group science” has led to the discovery of a number of DBA genotypes. Through the Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry (DBAR), opened in 1991, Dr. Lipton’s team has been able to provide a valuable substrate for laboratory investigations. In addition, they have developed mouse embryonic stem cell lines haploinsufficient for both rpl5 and rps19 that exhibit very different characteristics with regard to erythroid differentiation. In summary, the availability of animal models and a robust DBA database of well-characterized patients provide the cornerstone for advances in the diagnosis and treatment of DBA. Thus, translating knowledge from animal models to human disease is a natural progression of this work. Dr. Lipton’s group has referred patients from the United States, Canada and abroad with undiagnosed bone marrow failure syndromes for diagnostic evaluation.

Together with Dr. Manish Vira from the Urology Department, prostate cancer specimens are investigated with respect to their microRNA expression profiles. Gene expression and biomarkers in autoimmune diseases: Gene Expression in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is investigated in collaboration with Dr. Betty Diamond and Dr. Meggan Mackay. In particular differences between active and inactive SLE as well as between SLE flare and sepsis are studied for mRNA biomarkers in peripheral blood. In addition, the effect of Vitamin D treatment on gene expression in SLE patients is analyzed in a project together with Dr. Betty Diamond and Dr. Cynthia Aranow. Gene Set and modular expression analysis is applied to several projects. Together with Dr. Peter Gregersen, it was found that a modular analysis of peripheral blood gene expression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) captures reproducible gene expression changes in TNF responders.

She holds a joint appointment as professor in the departments of medicine and molecular medicine at Hofstra-North Shore LIJ School of Medicine. Dr. Sherry received her bachelor’s degree from Smith College and her doctoral degree from Brandeis University. Early in her career, while a postdoctoral fellow at The Rockefeller University, Dr. Sherry pioneered a protein-based strategy to discover novel cytokines – immune regulatory proteins secreted by blood cells – that play a role in protecting the body against pathogens. Her work led to the discovery of three novel proteins (MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MIP-2) whose actions are critical for both host defense and normal immune system homeostasis. These were three of the founding members of the group of proteins now known as chemokines – a class of secreted proteins that regulate cell movement and serve as the “traffic cops” of the immune system. Dr. Sherry’s laboratory continues to investigate the biological roles of these molecules in the body’s response to bacterial and viral infections and cancer. Dr. Sherry is an international authority on chemokine biology and has authored more than 90 peer-reviewed publications in this field and has been an inventor or co-inventor on seven patents. Her research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and Concerned Parents for AIDS Research. Dr. Sherry’s laboratory has had a long-standing interest in the mechanisms that coordinate the innate immune response — the body’s first line of defense against invading pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites and tumors. Early work led to the discovery of a novel set of chemoattractant proteins secreted by cells in response to bacterial challenge, and the determination that those proteins were in fact members of a larger family of proteins (the chemokine family) that plays a critical role in host defense and immune system homeostasis.

As with other inflammatory cytokines, the team now recognizes that excessive production of these same chemokine proteins and/or dysregulation of chemokine receptor expression can have harmful consequences and contribute to disease-associated pathology. Their ongoing research goal is to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate chemokine and chemokine receptor responses in healthy individuals, and to identify how these pathways are dysregulated in sepsis, HIV infection and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Their studies will identify new therapeutic targets to restore immune function and improve clinical outcome in disease.Her research projects include: Chemokine Receptor Regulation in Inflammation, Infection, and Sepsis; Regulation of host antiviral β-chemokine responses in HIV-infected individuals; Role of the Microenvironment in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/barbara-sherry-phd/	NA	Leukemia	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		455;456;1683;1684	7082;59742

She received her PhD in Microbiology from the State University of New York, Stony Brook in 1976, working on bacterial viruses. Dr. Steinberg went on to achieve a postdoctoral fellowship at SUNY Stony Brook, studying tumor viruses. After two years at Columbia University as a Senior Research Associate, Dr. Steinberg joined the Department of Otolaryngology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center where she began her studies of human papillomaviruses and their role in diseases of the head and neck, including recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and cancer. Those studies have been supported continuously by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 1983. Dr. Steinberg is the author or co-author of 93 peer-reviewed publications and 25 book chapters. Her important research has received a number of awards, including the Robert K. Match Distinguished Scientist Award, the Long Island Achiever in Science Award from the Long Island Center for Business and Professional Women, the Elliot Osserman Award from the Israel Cancer Research Fund, the Karl Storz Award from the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology, the Lorinda de Roulet Award for Excellence in Research, and the Israel Cancer Research Fund Award for Women of Excellence. Most recently, she served as President of the International Papillomavirus Society. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a large family of viruses that cause a wide range of benign and malignant tumors ranging from common skin warts and genital warts to cervical cancer and some cancers in the oral cavity. Nearly everyone is infected by HPVs, but most infections are latent (silent), with no evidence of disease. Dr. Steinberg’s research in the laboratory is primarily focused on diseases of the airway caused by HPVs. One of the diseases she studies is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a rare disease that affects both children and adults. The papillomas in RRP patients are benign, but the disease causes significant suffering and can even be fatal because the papillomas can block the airway. Surgical removal is the only approved treatment, but the papillomas often recur rapidly. In severe cases, surgery to clear the airway may be required as often as once a month. The papillomas are primarily located in the larynx, but approximately 17% of patients will have tracheal disease and 5% will have papillomas of the lung. There is no effective treatment for lung involvement, and the lung papillomas frequently convert to cancer. Improved treatments, based on better knowledge of the biology of the disease, are badly needed. HPVs also cause some head and neck cancers, especially tonsil cancers. Recent studies show that the cancers caused by HPVs are becoming much more common. Fortunately, those cancers usually respond well to treatment. Most of the research Dr. Steinberg does on RRP will be directly applicable to her studies of HPV-induced head and cancers as well. Promising avenues of research Dr. Steinberg and her team are following in their lab include the interactions between HPV and its target cells, the role of the immune system in controlling HPV-induced diseases, activation of latent HPV infection, a clinical trial of Celebrex as a treatment for RRP, studies on HPV-induced head and neck cancer, and studies of molecular mechanisms regulating metastasis of carcinomas and sarcomas.	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/bettie-m-steinberg-phd/	NA	Head & Neck;Sarcoma;Mets	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		362;363;364;365;366;367;368;369;370;371;372;373;406;407	8579;7110;7946;7112

Dr. Lovecchio  is the lead investigator in a collaboration between North Shore-LIJ and the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research to advance the development of a blood test for the early detection of ovarian cancer. The team has been studying the presence and levels of biomarkers such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in diseases. MiRNAs are small (19-25nt), noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding in the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of their specific messenger RNAs and interfering with translation. They are involved in normal cellular development, differentiation and proliferation. However, dysregulation of miRNA expression can have a causal role in malignancies. The presence and expression levels of specific tissue miRNAs have been associated with different types of cancer and clinical outcome. MiRNAs are remarkably stable and are well preserved in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples and have been detected in plasma and serum samples, making them ideal candidates for non-invasive biomarkers of disease.	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/john-lovecchio-md/; https://www.northshorelij.com/find-care/find-a-doctor/gynecologic-oncology/dr-john-louis-lovecchio-md-11307675	NA	Ovary;Uterus	Clinician, Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		762;763;761

Dr. Rai has been involved in diagnosing and treating CLL for almost 40 years and the staging system that bears his name came out of his early breakthrough research. He has been collaborating with Nicholas Chiorazzi, MD, and other CLL scientists at the Feinstein Institute for years and their shared commitment has made its mark in the field. Many of the important aspects of research, currently underway on CLL globally are based on discoveries at the Feinstein Institute. Because of its laboratory and clinical strengths, patients come for treatment in the program and are invited to participate in research at every level. There are basic science studies through Dr. Nicholas Chiorazzi’s lab and almost a dozen clinical trials through the CLL clinical program. Patients are eager to participate in the research underway because they know that it is the only way that scientists will arrive at answers that will ultimately drive towards an effective treatment for CLL. It’s translational science at its best. If clinicians see a pattern in their patients it will be brought back to the lab for further scrutiny. It is critical to understand the disease so that it can lead to better treatments. CLL is the most common leukemia in the Western world. From basic research to studies which are complemented through collaboration with other groups of scientists such as CLL Research Consortium and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), the CLL program at Feinstein and the North Shore-LIJ Health System has helped all patients with CLL.	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/rai-kanti-r-md/; https://www.northshorelij.com/find-care/find-a-doctor/hematology/dr-kanti-roop-rai-md-11309418	NA	Leukemia	Clinician, Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		530;531;532;533;534;535;536;537;538;539;540;541;524;12;525;526;527;528;529;1678;1500;1501;1502;1503;1688;950;951;1685;1686;1690;1689;1687;1683;1684		240;241;242;287;288;289

His clinical practice is confined to Pediatric Surgery and his special interests include complex neonatal surgery, pediatric minimal invasive surgery, and pediatric surgical oncology. Ewing Sarcoma is the second-most common bone and soft tissue malignancy of childhood. The long-term prognosis for patients with metastatic Ewing Sarcoma is poor, and more than two-thirds of these children will succumb to their disease within five years. Multi-agent chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, complemented by surgery and radiation for local control of the primary tumor site or isolated metastatic disease. Although these modalities may be successful for limited, local disease, metastatic Ewing Sarcoma continues to be a great challenge with few effective treatments. New therapeutic options are urgently needed to address these high-risk patients. Macrophages are phagocytic derivatives of circulating bone marrow-derived monocytes. Upon infiltration into tissues, macrophages serve a variety of homeostatic and immunoregulatory roles important to the adaptive and innate inflammatory responses. Similar to other immunoregulatory cells, macrophages exist in a spectrum of functional states, the extremes of which can be generally characterized by the pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Macrophages that infiltrate and subsequently comprise a substantial portion of the tumor microenvironment are termed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAM-induced malignant progression is reflected by a number of studies on various human tumor specimens that correlate overexpression of macrophage chemoattractants, as well as increased numbers of infiltrating macrophages, with worse prognoses. There is also increasing evidence that macrophages play an important role in establishing the “premetastatic niche,” altering the stromal environment at sites far from the primary tumor and enhancing extravasation and growth of metastatic cells. Few studies have examined the role of macrophages in Ewing Sarcoma, although some evidence suggests that TAMs may promote Ewing Sarcoma disease progression. CNI-1493, also known as semapimod, is a small molecule anti-inflammatory agent that has been shown to inhibit production of macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators without significantly affecting other cell lineage. Although the mechanism of action remains to be delineated, CNI-1493 has been deemed safe and well tolerated in humans, having completed a phase II clinical trial for Crohn’s disease without significant adverse side effects [41-44]. Given its safety profile, CNI-1493 has recently been identified as a possible TAM-targeting antitumor agent. In our lab we have discovered that CNI-1493 markedly decreases the incidence of invasive metastasis and tumor burden in a mouse model of Ewing Sarcoma, and that it suppresses M2 macrophage-stimulated tumor cell invasion and extravasation in vitro. We are also studying the relationship between metastases and the cyclooxygenase pathway focusing on the potential for commercially available COX-2 inhibitors, used as anti-inflammatory agents, as potential anti-metastatic agents. Our goal is to develop an up-front anti-metastatic regimen for pediatric solid tumors that have high metastatic potential which when coupled with surgical excision of the primary tumor and standard adjuvant therapies will lead to enhanced long term survival.	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/samuel-z-soffer-md/	NA	Sarcoma;Mets;Brain;CNS;Kidney	Clinician, Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		409;408;406;407

Its site of action is thought to be the guanine residues in the DNA chain forming inter and intrastrand cross-links. Unfortunately, cancer cells which are initially often responsive, develop resistance, limiting its effectiveness. There have been many studies attempting to find specific markers for resistance to cisplatin, including genes in the AKT, ROS, 14-3-3 zeta, ER stress and cell cycle pathways. However, when a stable resistant ovarian cancer cell line was analyzed with cDNA microarrays followed by cDNA transfection of the candidate genes, an enzyme dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, (which has been previously implicated in the metabolic reduction and activation/inactivation of several xenobiotics) was found to produce cisplatin resistance. We showed that transfection or knockout of this enzyme from a whole series of tumor cell lines, including those derived from lung, cervical, testicular, ovarian primary tumors; resulted in significantly increased (transfection) or decreased (knockout) resistance to cisplatin. Recently, we have found that this enzyme is implicated in cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinomas, but not mesotheliomas nor small cell carcinomas. In addition, another enzyme which has previously been implicated in platinum resistance, (glutathione transferase pi) was found to be present in cell lines which do not contain dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (e.g. hematologic and lung mesothelioma cell lines). Knockdown of this enzyme resulted in sensitization of a whole series of lymphoma cell lines to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin-drugs that have been used successfully in previously-treated patients with refractory lymphomas. The ultimate aim of this work is to determine whether inhibitors to these two enzymes will sensititize resistant cells to platinum based chemotherapy.	http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/our-researchers/henry-simpkins-phd-md/; https://www.northshorelij.com/find-care/find-a-doctor/pathology-hematology/dr-henry-simpkins-md-11366774	NA	Cervical;Lung;Lymphoma;Ovary;Testicular;Breast;Head & Neck	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA		410;411;412;413

The following are several examples of such studies: (1) In one group of studies, we had previously shown that higher dose total body irradiation given in conjunction with hematopoietic cell transplantation was able to more reliably eradicate AML, but was associated with increased transplant-related toxicities. We have since shown the feasibility of targeting radiation therapy specifically to sites of normal and abnormal hematopoiesis using monoclonal antibodies against CD45 radiolabeled with 131I, and phase II trials incorporating this approach in transplant preparative regimens have yielded encouraging results. Current studies are aimed at further improving the specificity of targeting radiotherapy and defining the optimal way to apply this technique. (2) In a second group of experiments, we found that following exposure to cell-damaging agents, AML cells dramatically increase cellular cholesterol content and that blocking this response specifically sensitizes cells to chemotherapy. Subsequent clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility of adding high dose pravastatin to leukemia induction therapy with encouraging clinical outcomes. We are currently attempting to conclusively define the role of cholesterol synthesis blockade in AML treatment. (3) In collaboration with the Southwest Oncology group, we have found that MDR1 mediated drug efflux in AML is increased in older patients and in patients with recurrent disease, and is tightly associated with drug resistance. We have completed studies showing an advantage of the use of MDR1 inhibition in patients with recurrent AML and are currently conducting clinical trials in the up-front treatment of older patients. In addition, we have identified novel compounds that inhibit not only drug efflux but the effects of BCL-2 overexpression and are attempting to define the optimal way in which to apply such therapy.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/appelbaum-frederick	NA	Leukemia	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			18029;69246;7689;15704;180828

Allogeneic HCT has the potential to provide long-term survival and even cure in patients with hematological malignancies. Nonetheless, relapse of malignancy after HCT remains a major cause of transplant failure. Patients who develop graft versus-host disease (GVHD) have reduced relapse rates, suggesting that lymphocytes present in engrafted cells can mediate a concurrent therapeutic graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. One strategy to enhance the GVL effect without promoting GVHD in post-HCT patients is to target leukemia-associated antigens with antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). In my current research in collaboration with Drs. Aude Chapuis and Phil Greenberg we transduced donor derived CD8 cytotoxic T cell with lentiviral vercor, which carries a gene that encodes a high affinity WT1-specific T cell receptor (TCR). The zinc finger transcription factor Wilms tumor antigen 1 (WT1) is expressed at 10- to 1000-fold higher concentrations in leukemic cells compared to normal CD34+ cells, and the magnitude of expression correlates with clinical aggressiveness of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). Thus, T cells that express high affinity WT1-specific TCR may be able to generate an effective and specific GVL with lower risk of GVHD. In order to evaluate the potential anti leukemic effect of those cells, we have designed a clinical trial to determine the safety and function associated with treating patients with high risk or relapsed AML, MDS, and CML after allogeneic HCT by adoptive transfer of donor-derived CD8 T cells genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific TCR.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/bar-merav.html	NA	Leukemia;Myelodysplastic Syndrome	Clinician, Research			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

In these efforts we have identified maturation linked cell surface antigens and have utilized this information for developing methods for targeted therapy of hematologic malignancies and for isolating and characterizing normal and malignant human hematopoietic stem cells. These studies have led to the development of stem cell transplantation using isolated CD34+ cells and for Notch ligand-induced expansion of repopulating cell numbers currently being tested in a clinical trial of cord blood transplantation. Our studies of malignant hematopoiesis have examined the clonal origin of AML and have suggested that in some patients, the leukemic cells develop from a clone of mature CD33+ progenitors, or that the leukemia involves only occasional less mature CD33- precursor cells that expand in an uncontrolled manner after maturation to a CD33+ CFC. For these patients, we have hypothesized that ablation of CD33+precursors would restore normal hematopoiesis in patients with AML. On this basis, in collaboration with Wyeth-Ayerst, we have developed a conjugate for the selective ablation of CD33+ cells and demonstrated its ability to induce remissions in at least some patients with AML, supporting the notion of the predominantly or completely normal origin of the CD33- precursors. This conjugate has been approved by the FDA and our current studies are evaluating the effects of multi-drug resistance genes and the stem cell origin of AML on the efficacy of this drug. Current studies of normal hematopoiesis are aimed at determining methods to direct primitive hematopoietic precursors to commit to a particular maturational pathway or to self-renew. The studies focus on the role of Notch signaling in the regulation of cell fate decisions during hematopoietic differentiation. These studies have demonstrated that constitutive Notch1 signaling can enhance self-renewal and immortalization of cytokine-dependent pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. We have further demonstrated that Notch signaling induced by interaction of hematopoietic precursor cells with exogenous Notch ligand enhances the formation of primitive multipotential precursors and are presently evaluating whether the formation of hematopoietic stem cells is also enhanced. Based on these findings we developed novel methods for enhancing the repopulating capacity of human hematopoietic precursor cells. In studies with cord blood cells, culture with engineered Notch ligand led to a substantial increase in the number of CD34+ cells and in the rate and magnitude of repopulation in immunodeficient mice. In a Phase I clinical trial in patients with hematologic malignancies, we demonstrated that these cells will provide rapid early engraftment, and hypothesize they will decrease the early transplant related morbidity and mortality seen in patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation and may also contribute to improvement in overall survival.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/bernstein-irwin	NA	Leukemia	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			9351;76930;5480;80245;1;9001;9002;84205;100395;6051

How do cells faithfully inherit a complete set of chromosomes during every cell division? My laboratory is focused on elucidating the mechanisms that govern chromosome segregation. Because aneuploidy is a hallmark of all cancers and many birth defects, studies on chromosome segregation are critical to understanding how cells maintain genomic stability and prevent disease. Chromosomes segregate using their kinetochores, the specialized protein structures that are assembled on centromeric DNA sequences and attach to dynamic spindle microtubules. Sister kinetochores must make bioriented attachments to microtubules from opposite poles. Defects in making bioriented kinetochore attachments are detected by the spindle checkpoint that halts the cell cycle until the errors are corrected. My lab is studying many key questions about chromosome segregation, including how kinetochores assemble, how kinetochores make bioriented microtubule attachments, and how the spindle checkpoint detects and corrects defects in these processes. Kinetochores contain a specialized centromeric chromatin structure containing a conserved centromeric histone H3 variant (CenH3) that appears to be the epigenetic mark that specifies the site of kinetochore assembly. We previously discovered that CenH3 is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis to restrict CenH3 localization to kinetochores. We have recently identified a ubiquitin ligase that degrades CenH3 that mislocalizes to euchromatin and are currently studying its regulation. We also have a number of projects studying histone modifications that are important for various aspects of centromeric function. We also study the regulation of kinetochore biorientation and the spindle checkpoint. A key regulator of chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes is the Ipl1/Aurora protein kinase. Because the Aurora kinases are oncogenes, studies on the budding yeast Ipl1 protein are critical to understanding both chromosome segregation and the maintenance of genomic stability. Current projects in the lab are directed at identifying key substrates for Ipl1 and Glc7 as well as understanding the precise temporal and spatial regulation of the enzymes. Recently, we reconstituted kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vitro using purified kinetochore particles. We are collaborating with Chip Asbury's lab at UW to perform biophysical experiments to further understand the mechanisms that regulate attachments. We are also collaborating with Tamir Gonen to elucidate structural details about kinetochores and their mode of attachment to microtubules. Finally, we are using this assay to identifiy novel post-translational modifications on kinetochores and to reconstitute the spindle checkpoint in vitro. Taken together, these studies should continue to elucidate new details about the mechanisms of chromosome segregation and thus aid in understanding the generation of aneuploidy and disease progression.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/biggins-sue	NA	Any	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			64386;78069

Our focus is to understand how the commitment to the mitotic cell cycle is regulated in response to environmental and internal cues. The critical transitions in the eukaryotic cell cycle are controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In budding yeast, as in all higher eukaryotes, the decision to commit to another division cycle occurs in G1. Nine cyclins have been identified that bind and activate a single CDK, and three of these cyclins (Cln1,2 and 3) play critical roles in modulating the decision to enter the cell cycle. We are studying what controls the activity of these three G1 cyclins and other critical regulators of the transition into S phase.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/breeden-linda	NA	Any?

Mouse models have challanged our understanding the biochemical mechanisms of CDK regulation in mammals and have demonstrated both generalized and tissue specific patterns of cellular growth control. Targeted disruption of the CKI genes, p27Kip1, causes a hyperplastic syndrome with increased tumor susceptibility, and CDK activation. A non-protein encoding RNA transcript, Xpcl1, is located on the X-chromosome and encodes a cluster of microRNAs. When activated these miRNA cause T-cell lymphomas through an unknown mechanism. We have shown that Xpcl1 expression and cell cycle activation are highly synergistic with respect to tumor development. We are working to understand the mechanism of action of the Xpcl1 miRNA and whether they may be used as novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets. Although hematopoiesis is one of the best characterized cellular developmental pathways our understanding key regulators is lacking as evidenced by our limited ability to faithfully grow blood cells in the laboratory and our inability to purify homogeneous progenitor populations. We have initiated a project to address these constraints by characterizing transcriptiome variation of individual hematopoietic progenitor populations with second generation RNA-Seq technology, and the development of novel gene expression reporters.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/fero-matthew.html	NA	Leukemia;Lymphoma	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

We are examining the essential detail of the genetics and genomics of the immune response in humans and nonhuman primates, detail that differs among individuals and directly affects a plethora of immune interactions and derivative clinical outcomes. In order to identify and understand this detail we are developing novel laboratory approaches combined with essential software to increase both the breadth and depth of information that can be acquired. These tools are being used to identify the causative genetic components underlying common diseases. In functional analysis, we have studied the roles of the nonclassical MHC class I genes HLA-E, F, and G in immunity. A major recent focus has been on understanding HLA-F function, revealing new insights into the role of HLA-F – expressed as an open conformer without peptide or β2-microglobulin – in the regulation of immune system functions and immune defense. This work has extended to a new paradigm for MHC class I open conformer function, including the classical HLA-A, B, and C antigens, intersecting the innate and adaptive immune responses. Clinical Interest: Genetic studies of common disease. Our workflow includes novel protocols, reagents, and software that extend readily to genotyping at other loci as well. In application, we are currently supporting the FHCRC transplant program and vaccine trials network in association studies of relevant clinical outcomes. 	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/geraghty-daniel.html	NA	Any;Heme?

The Clinical Research Division at the FHCRC performs more stem cell transplants than any other institution in the world. The first transplant in Seattle was done in 1969, and currently roughly 450 transplants are done yearly. These facts put the FHCRC in a unique position to conduct both small- and large-scale clinical trials designed to address some of the most important and interesting questions that face the transplantation community today. The large volume of data generated from past transplants also provides a rich database from which information can be used to generate hypotheses and to monitor progress made in the field. In recent years, many dose-finding studies have been designed within the Clinical Division with the goal of determining whether of not an effective dose of a treatment can be found such that the dose appears both safe and efficacious. This is in contrast to the more standard Phase I setting where one may be concerned only with safety and not efficacy. One such example is selective depletion of T cells in the donor marrow, where it is desired to find a dose of T cells that is associated with acceptable rates of graft failure while at the same timebeing associated with acceptable rates of severe graft-versus-host disease. With the advent of the National Marrow Donor Program, use of alternative donors is becoming more commonplace for patients who lack a suitable family-member donor. It has beenshown in certain diseases that the time from diagnosis to transplant is an important prognostic factor in predicting outcome after transplantation and that outcome is adversely affected by donors who fail to share certain HLA antigens with the patient. A decision often needs to be made by both patient and physician whether to get transplanted early with a less-than-optimal donor or to wait longer in the hope of finding a more suitable donor. We are currently in the process of dealing with these and related issues for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who receive a transplant from an unrelated donor. The prevention and treatment of fungal and viral infections continues to be a problem following stem cell transplantation due to the immunocompromised condition of the patient. We have completed several randomized, controlled trials in recent years, and others are currently underway. These trials have led to significant progress in the prevention and treatment of certain infections, and the resultsof past and current clinical trials continue to shape strategies used to deal with such complications.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/gooley-theodore	NA	Leukemia	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

His work includes uncovering fundamental mechanisms that regulate how genes are turned on and off in normal cells and how the misregulation of these mechanisms lead to cancer. In recognition of Dr. Groudine¹s contributions to the fields of molecular biology and oncology, he has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and as a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Research in the Groudine laboratory focuses on the relationships between gene expression, chromatin structure and the organization of the interphase nucleus during hematopoietic differentiation.  They have: (1) analyzed the function of cis-acting regulatory elements in the human and mouse beta-globin loci by targeted deletions (accomplished via homologous and site specific recombination); (2) determined the composition of tissue-specific transcription complexes prior to and after differentiation (by mass spectrometry); and (3) determined the binding of such complexes to regulatory elements by chromatin immune-precipitation (ChIP).  They have combined these molecular and biochemical studies with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize the nuclear location of specific DNA sequences and regulatory proteins during differentiation in vivo and in vitro. Their results suggest a multi-step model for gene activation, involving alterations in the nuclear location of the loci and transactivators, the binding of these factors to regulatory elements in the beta-globin loci, and the subsequent high level transcription of the beta-globin genes.  Their work has also revealed that the mammalian interphase nucleus is organized in a non-random, tissue-specific fashion reflecting the genomic organization and transcription state of genes that are co-regulated during differentiation.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/groudine-mark.html	NA	Any	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			146572;44746;65440;30856;27271

In eukaryotes, RNA polymerases are components of large protein machines that integrate regulatory signals and position polymerase at gene regulatory regions. Most subunits of the transcription machinery are essential for viability, and regulation of transcription is one of the key steps controlling cell identity, growth, development and stress response. Misregulation of transcription is a major cause of human disease. Research in the laboratory aims to decipher key mechanisms used by the transcription machinery and by regulatory factors that are fundamental to the regulation of transcription. Nearly all of these mechanisms have been conserved in eukaryotes. The laboratory provides an excellent learning environment for students and postdoctoral fellows to address scientific questions using a multidisciplinary approach. Our long term goals are to understand: (i) the mechanism of the general transcription factors in promoting transcription by RNA polymerase and (ii) the mechanism of transcription activation by gene-specific regulatory factors.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/hahn-steven	NA	Any	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			53451;75114

The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), or HLA system, comprises multiple linked genes that play critical roles in regulating cellular immune responses and immunity. T cells recognize antigen derived peptides that are selected and presented by HLA class I and class II molecules. Natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells have inhibitory and stimulatory receptors that recognize epitopes encoded by HLA class I and class I-like molecules. Genetic variation in HLA genes is associated with susceptibility and resistance to infection, autoimmune disease and cancer. Genetic variation in HLA genes and differences between donors and recipients are major barriers to successful transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) from normal donors, familial or unrelated, may be rejected or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may result secondary to alloimmune reactions induced by HLA disparity. Current studies in this lab are aimed at understanding the relevance and minimal requirements for genetic matching of donor and recipient in HSCT, the utility of genetic testing and functional assays to guide donor selection, and the mechanism by which tolerance occurs following HSCT. Studies are also underway to identify functional genetic variation in cytokine and other immune regulation genes in donors and recipients, and to determine if these genomic differences contribute to regimen-related toxicity, GVHD, and non-relapse mortality after HSCT. Methods have been developed for monitoring T cell alloimmune responses in vivo. Host reactive T cells are identified in short-term culture using CFSE staining and multi-parameter flow cytometry to monitor the frequencies of responding CD4 and CD8 cells. Effector cell function is further classified by intracellular staining for cytokines. The clonal variation of responding T cells is determined by spectratyping of T cell receptor (TCR) V-beta gene rearrangements. Donor T cell responses to host alloantigen is highly diverse. Many clones appear for a limited period of time suggesting that sequential activation and deletion may be occurring. Other clones persist for several months to years following transplantation. A high rate of spontaneous apoptosis is found among peripheral blood T cells during the first few months following transplantation primarily among T cells expressing activation markers. This activation induced cell death is not random but appears to be biased at the clonal level. Apoptosis occurs more frequently in HLA-mismatched transplants and patients with severe GVHD. Apoptosis decreases with administration of cortical steroids but increases again in patients who subsequently fail treatment or become steroid dependent. Studies are underway to further understand how T cell activation leads to apoptosis and whether or not this phenomenon simply represents clonal deletion. A better understanding of these in vivo reactions could lead to improved strategies for monitoring the immune suppression therapy facilitating tolerance induction and improving immune reconstitution.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/hansen-john	NA	Heme?

In my role as Scientific Director of the Center's Clinical Cell Therapy Laboratory and the cGMP Therapeutic Manufacturing Facility, a position I have held for over 10 years, I have a very strong appreciation for quality control, quality assurance, and compliance with regulations. I also direct several research based cores, ranging from specimen repositories to multi-parameter flow cytometry to large-scale cell processing. I have been using/developing various cell sorting techniques for over 25 years, starting as a graduate student at UC Irvine through post-doctoral training at Stanford with Irv Weissman to high-speed FACS at SyStemix to the first FDA-approved CD34 selection device at CellPro. Those previous experiences, along with my current research and clinical responsibilities, have emphasized the need for teamwork, collaboration, and cooperation to help advance scientific understanding. The CCEH model continues to build on those same values by providing high quality support services to the research community. Under my leadership as Core Director, the CCEH Cell Processing core has experienced tremendous growth, supported investigators from all over the country, and contributed to a very extensive number of publications.

Relapses result from either the infusion of contaminating tumor cells in the stem cell product and/or from the incomplete eradication of endogenous malignant cells by the transplant conditioning regimens. Directly following an autologous transplant, the immune system is relatively incompetent and this immune incompetence may contribute to the high relapse rates seen after autologous transplantation. My clinical research interests have focused on trying to augment the immune system after an autologous transplant. A number of clinical trials using different approaches have been developed. Treating with immunological and non-immunological therapies posttransplant can possibly change the time to relapse and prolong survival.

The publication of the sequence of the human genome and breakthroughs in the high throughput technologies for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, gene expression, and protein measurements have offered new opportunities for the study of genome complexity. New technologies are generating large amounts of high-dimensional data at an astounding speed. Relative to the high dimension of the data the number of independent samples is often rather small, either because the techniques are too expensive, or because it is hard to obtain enough independent biological samples. Clearly, the development of new statistical techniques is required for the extraction of useful biological information from such data. Adaptive regression methods, which combine variable selection and nonlinear modeling, are well suited for many of these problems. In my research I try to develop and enhance these methods to address the practical problems that arise directly from several collaborative projects. In particular I focus on association studies with SNP, microarray, and proteomics data. For SNP association studies we have developed Logic Regression. Logic Regression is a methodology for regression problems in which all (most) of the predictors are binary, and in which our interest is to discover potential high order interactions between these predictors. In Logic Regression new predictors that are logic (Boolean) combinations of the binary predictors are constructed. There are numerous situations in which data is generated by some (unknown) mechanism, where interest lies in estimating a function that is related to a model for the data. In the polynomial spline approach we model such a function to be in a linear space of smooth piecewise polynomials (splines). In practice we often use stepwise algorithms to determine this space adaptively. For example, in the popular proportional hazards model the dependence of survival times on the covariates is modeled fully parametrically. Hazard regression (HARE) employs an adaptive algorithm based on splines to model the conditional log-hazard function. It does not assume a proportional hazards model, but it contains these models as a special subclass. I am both interested in developing similar nonparametric methodologies for other function estimation problems, as in the extension of existing methods to applications of these methodologies. In addition, I am actively involved in the activities of the Clinical Coordinating Center of the Women's Health Initiative. This is a 15-year program that involves a clinical trial of 67,500 postmenopausal women and an observational study of an additional 100,000 women. The primary outcomes that are studied are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease and hip fractures. Within the coordinating center I am primarily involved in the outcomes procedures and the periodic reporting to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/kooperberg-charles.html	NA	Any	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			4790;6124;7376

The Leukemia Committee and Leukemia Biology Program of the Southwest Oncology Group conduct a variety of studies concerning adult leukemias. These include clinical trials of new and promising treatments for the various kinds of leukemia, as well as laboratory studies to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and prognosis of these diseases. The investigators at the Southwest Oncology Group Statistical Center collaborate in the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of these studies. A continuing major focus of the Southwest Oncology Group's leukemia research is the problem of multidrug resistance. Patients whose leukemia is resistant to remission induction therapy have a very poor prognosis. Recent and ongoing studies have shown that such resistance is a complex phenomenon, possibly involving multiple mechanisms, some of which protect leukemic cells from cytotoxic agents,and others of which may interfere with that protection. The Group's studies are intended to elucidate these mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of finding ways to overcome multidrug resistance. Radiation epidemiology is the study of how risks of diseases such as certain types of cancer are affected when people are exposed to radiation. The Hanford Thyroid Disease Study investigated whether thyroid disease, including thyroid cancer, has been increased among persons exposed to radioactive iodine released from the Hanford Nuclear Site in south-central Washington State during the 1940s and 1950s. Scientists from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center are also engaged with Russian colleagues in a multinational project (the International Consortium for Research on the Health Effects of Radiation) to investigate the radiation doses and health consequences in areas of Russia contaminated by fallout from the Chernobyl accident in April 1986.

Most of my collaborative research focuses on the design, analysis and conduct of therapeutic clinical trials. I lead the statistical activities related to Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in lymphoma for the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG). Recently I have been investigating design and analysis methods for targeting patient subgroups appropriate for both Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. I am interested in the study of adaptive regression methods and their application to data arising from clinical trials. I have developed extensions or alternatives to tree-based methods to yield simple prognostic decision rules in collaboration with Dr. John Crowley (Cancer Research And Biostatistics, CRAB). One example of such methodology is a strategy for constructing prognostic groups based on recursive refinement or peeling algorithms which allow for calibration of the risk group in terms of outcome or fraction of patients in the group. In addition, I have recently developed an algorithm called Extreme Regression for constructing either high- or low-risk outcome groups in collaboration with Dr. Charles Kooperberg and James Moon (FHCRC). The model leads to a simple inverse regression function which is represented as a Boolean decision rule similar to tree models. However, unlike trees, the new method can control the fraction of subjects identified by the rule. Some of my other work has included methods for analyzing gene-expression and SNP data. A successful project was Logic Regression, a method which constructs predictors based on Boolean combinations of binary feature variables (led by Charles Kooperberg and originally part of Ingo Ruczinski's dissertation). I am also currently working on methods that allow specification of genetic structure into the high dimensional regression problem.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/leblanc-michael.html	NA	Lymphoma	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			90998;38926;180819

Over the long history of transplantation at the Center, our group has also developed a large database of patient data that allows us to carry out retrospective analyses to generate hypotheses for future prospective studies. For patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, infection is a very serious development and more accurate and earlierdetection of disease is an important research topic amongst infectious disease researchers. More globally, diagnostic and screening programs are becoming a large and costly component of our health care system. It is therefore important that research leading to the implementation of new tests be rigorous in determining the accuracy of the tests. A primary goal of my methodological research is to develop statistical methods that allow researchers to answer relevant clinical questions about diagnostic tests. We have described marginal regression methods for the comparison of multiple diagnostic tests and evaluation of covariate impacts on sensitivity and specificity parameters when one or more test outcomes are obtained on each subject studied. Additionally, we developed a new regression methodology for diagnostic likelihood ratios, quantities that describe the degree to which the outcome of a diagnostic test revises the pre-test odds of disease. Most recently, we have developed a statistical test for the comparison of predictive values of diagnostic tests when the data was obtained under paired study designs.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/leisenring-wendy.html	NA	Pediatric Cancer	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			54498

As a psychologist at the Southwest Oncology Group's Statistical Center (located at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), I help coordinate quality of life and behavioral research conducted in SWOG trials. A number of outcomes or endpoints are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a new cancer treatment (e.g., overall survival time, decrease in tumor size, etc.). Comprehensive and systematic reports from patients of their quality of life during and after cancer treatment can also help evaluate cancer treatments. A comprehensive measure of quality of life involves a patient-completed questionnaire or interview addressing physical, emotional, and social functioning as well as symptom status and a global assessment of quality of life. It is important to include questions about symptoms that are associated with the cancer (e.g., bone pain) as well as symptoms associated with the treatment (e.g., nausea or mouth sores). Systematic assessment requires collecting information from patients on a regular schedule and in a standardized fashion. These data can supplement physicians' inquiries regarding how patients are doing and the physician ratings of patient symptoms (treatment-related toxicities) routinely collected in clinical trials. A difficult issue in quality of life research is deciding when and for how long patients should rate their functioning. Sometimes, we are interested in documenting the side effects associated with a treatment (i.e., more short-term, acute effects). In other cases, we are more interested in seeing if quality of life improves over time and documenting the degree to which patients are able to return to normal work and family routines. Or, we may want to follow patients long enough to be certain that there are no long-term negative effects of the cancer treatment. Quality of life issues in some studies are more compelling than in others. For example, treatment for patients with advanced stage disease is usually expected to be palliative rather than curative. A quality of life questionnaire is an excellent way of documenting the extent to which palliation was achieved. Finally, quality of life outcomes are also of interest in cancer prevention trials. In this case, the objective is monitoring the continued health status and quality of life of healthy individuals who enroll in a cancer prevention study. In Southwest Oncology Group clinical trials. We have documented both symptom reduction over the course of treatment and increases in symptoms as a result of treatment-related side effects. We have also shown that baseline measures of symptom status and physical functioning predict patient survival. With funding from the National Cancer Institute, we have translated the SWOG Quality of Life Questionnaire into Spanish and are conducting a study to validate the translation. We are currently assessing the quality of life of healthy men participating in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). We will also be monitoring quality of life in a newly funded prostate cancer prevention trial, the SELenium and Vitamin E Chemoprevtion Trial (SELECT). My work on the PCPT includes efforts to encourage recruitment to the trial, particularly among members of minority groups. A minority recruitment manual was produced for the PCPT. Additional effort and research targeted adherence to PCPT trial requirements over its seven-year period and involved focus groups, production of videos, and activities conducted by sites to encourage adherence. My work on the SELECT trial addressed early recruitment activities. I have designed the quality of life assessment strategy for both the PCPT and SELECT trials in conjunction with a number of colleagues who do research in this area. Finally, quality of life questionnaires provide the primary outcomes for evaluating the effectiveness of a counseling intervention for women with a first recurrence of breast cancer. Cost is another relevant outcome measure for cancer clinical trials. I have helped develop a set of resource utilization forms to document cost of care for two treatment arms in an advanced non-small cell lung cancer trial conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group. This type of outcome is very staff-intensive and will only be included in selected trials. However, cost information certainly adds to the evaluation of competing treatments for cancer. We have also been able to document the resource-intensive nature of collecting and monitoring submission of quality of life data in Southwest Oncology Group trials, particularly at the data center.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/moinpour-carol.html	NA	Breast;Prostate	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

The role of the HLA system has been established in solid organ and stem cell transplantation as pivotal for the acceptance of the engrafted tissue. Historically, alloantisera have been used to discriminate epitopes that define HLA antigens. With the advent of PCR-based tools in the mid-1980s, it became clear that a single serologically-defined antigen could be encoded by several unique sequences. Our effort has been directed at designing robust DNA-based methods to assay these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in class I HLA-A, B, C and class II DRB1, DQB1 and DPB1 genes. Application of these methods has allowed a more precise and complete characterization of patients and unrelated donors. This work has elucidated the functional role of class II SNPs in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the role of class I SNPs in graft failure, and the importance of number of donor or recipient disparities in defining the overall success of unrelated donor transplantation. We have extended our studies to build an international effort among transplant centers, donor registries and laboratories to understand permissible mismatches. Hypotheses that we are currently testing include the identification of non-HLA SNPs having functional relevance in transplantation, and the application of molecular methods to understand the nature of SNPs having relevance in solid tumor model systems.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/petersdorf-effie-wang.html	NA	Pediatric/Blood	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			69197;45;100019;162194;5851

A normal cell cycle always contains a period of mitogen dependence, which usually occupies the first few hours after each mitosis. If the requisite mitogenic signals are not received during this time, the cell will withdraw transiently into a quiescent state or sometimes more permanently undergo a post-mitotic arrest. However, once this mitogen-sensitive period ends the cellenters an autonomous state where the remaining events of the division cycle, including DNA replication and mitosis, occur independently of extracellular stimuli. In this way, each cell cycle is organized into alternating states of responsiveness and nonresponsiveness to environmental signals. The switch between these states reflects a point of commitment to complete one division cycle, and therefore represents the primary proliferative decision of the cell. It is currently thought that mitogenic signals ultimately effect cell proliferation by modulating the activities of the proteins which control progression through the cell cycle. A family of protein kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), control transit through the mitogen-sensitive portion of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and it has been shown that their activities are dependent on mitogenic stimuli. The catalytic activity of CDKs is regulated by two general mechanisms, protein phosphorylation and association with regulatory subunits. Thetwo kinds of CDK regulatory subunits are CDK activators (named cyclins) and CDK inhibitors (named CKIs). The cyclins are periodically expressed during the cell cycle and upon binding to a CDK induce structural rearrangements that are both necessary for CDK catalytic activity and also help to determine its substrate specificity. The CKIs work in opposition to the cyclins. They bind directly to CDKs or cyclin-CDK complexes and inhibit their protein kinase activity. The coordinate regulation of cyclins and CKIs determines in large part the effect of mitogenic or antimitogenic signaling on CDK activity, and thereby causes the cell cycle to either start or stop. Our laboratory is now focused on understanding how the activities of the cyclins and the CKIs are regulated during the cell cycle and how these proteins cooperate to control the mitogen responsiveness of cells both in vivo and in vitro. Our studies include both normal and tumorigenic cells.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/roberts-james	NA	Any	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			118043;120294

I see adult patients with hematologic malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma from the time they arrive for consideration for an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. I also attend on the inpatient bone marrow transplant service at the University of Washington Medical Center, the outpatient allogeneic transplant service at the SCCA which follows patients for their first 100 days post transplant and I frequently staff the long term follow-up clinic.   As a member of the Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant (UCBT) research program, the goal of my research is to improve the long-term outcomes of UCBT in patients with hematologic malignancies. My research concentrates primarily on adults who are receiving reduced intensity conditioning regimens. I am looking at ways to reduce infections, prevent graft-versus-host disease and decrease relapse in this patient population and improve their long-term quality of life.

Genetic recombination plays a crucial role in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity and the generation of genetic diversity. During mitotic growth of cells, faithful repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) requires homologous recombination. Failure to repair DSBs is often lethal, as essential genes can be lost. During meiosis, recombination plays an important role in the proper segregation of chromosomes and the formation of viable sex cells. Aberrancies in recombination thus produce chromosomal losses and rearrangements, such as deletions and translocations, and can result in birth defects or cancers. Understanding the molecular mechanism of recombination will give us insight into the causes of these diseases and possibly ways of predicting or preventing them; it will also help create new cell lines and mutant organisms by gene targeting. Common features of recombination in model organisms, including easily studied microorganisms, aid identifying human genes for recombination and DSB repair, which may be altered in specific diseases such as cancer. Our lab's goals are to elucidate how recombination and DSB repair are accomplished and how they are regulated to occur at the proper place and time. Our research is focused on meiotic recombination in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and on the major (RecBCD) pathway of recombination in the bacterium Escherichia coli. In both organisms we approach this problem genetically, by analyzing mutants altered in the process, and biochemically, by studying the enzymes and special DNA sites (hotspots) that promote recombination and repair. These approaches are greatly facilitated by the advanced genetics and biochemistry of these microorganisms.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/smith-gerald	NA	Any	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			83736;31693;32194;3

It involves clinical and population based studies meant to optimize the benefits of healthcare to the patient and society. Procedures could include testing, developing, and validation methods and tools to predict treatment outcomes; understanding patients’ experiences, preferences and values for treatment of cancer; and generating evidence to determine which interventions work best for which types of patients and under what circumstances. Outcomes analyzed include survival, toxicities, and quality of life. He conducts several multi-center clinical studies aimed at developing tools and information to guide choices of therapy in vulnerable (older or with numerous medical problems) patients with blood cancer and to better evaluate the usefulness of different treatment approaches including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Tools include comorbidity indices, patient-reported surveys of quality of life and function, and plasma and candidate genetic biomarkers. Dr. Sorror research also involves new methods to maximize the benefits of nonmyeloablative conditioning and allogeneic HCT for older and medically infirm patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma. One approach is investigating whether the addition of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) to the nonmyeloablative conditioning could improve survival. Another approach is combining high-dose myeloablative autologous HCT, for disease debulking, with allogeneic HCT from HLA-haploidentical donor using nonmyeloablative regimen, for continued graft-versus disease consolidation. Current Studies: Impact of Comorbidities and Age on Outcomes of Allogeneic Transplantation. Assessment of biomarkers for prognostic evaluation of transplant outcomes. Predictors of treatment-related mortality after autologous transplantation. Clinical and biological understanding of the roles of comorbidities in development of post-transplant complications.

Dr. Stirewalt’s lab, in collaboration with other labs at the FHCRC and across the country, uses novel high throughput technologies to achieve these goals. These technologies include next generation sequencing of DNA, mRNA, and miRNA, as well as evaluation of proteomic signatures. These novel biomarkers are then validated in larger cohorts of patients, using samples from cooperative groups such as the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) and Children’s Oncology Group (COG). Given the strong link between aging and myeloid malignancies, Dr Stirewalt is also investigating how selective candidates may link aging to myeloid transformation. Such studies may identify early transforming events that can be used as early predictors for the development of these diseases or to develop novel therapeutic agents that reverse prior to the development of the disease. Clinical Expertise: Dr. Stirewalt’s clinical expertise lies within the evaluation and treatment of patients with hematopoietic malignancies, with a particular interest in those patients with leukemia. He has been an active member of the FHCRC’s transplant program for over 10 years and routinely oversees the care of patients receiving either an autologous or allogeneic transplant at the Center.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin. This allows compact storage of the genome, but limits the access of DNA binding proteins to their targets. Therefore, chromatin structure strongly influences all the processes that rely on protein-DNA interactions, such as transcription, DNA replication, repair and recombination. We are therefore elucidating the mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure in vivo to understand how these fundamental processes can be achieved. We are using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, because functions of genes can be studied most readily by genetic and biochemical approaches in this system but easily applied to multicellular eukaryotes. At the current time, our interest is focused in the following areas. One goal is to understand the mechanisms of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. To address this issue, we are studying a few ATPases that have potent biochemical activities to change chromatin structure. These enzymes have been known to be required for normal transcriptional regulation and DNA replication, as well as maintenance of chromosome structure. However, how they function at the molecular level is not well understood. For example, it is not understood how they might alter nucleosome structure to allow the transctional machinery access to promoters. We are using molecular genetic, biochemical and genomic approaches to understand what these factors do, and how they function in vivo. We also study how chromatin structure affects DNA replication. It is a complete mystery how the DNA replication machinery can copy the genome with complete precision in the context of the complex and compact chromatin template that it must duplicate. We are currently focusing on how histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling affect DNA replication. We are also trying to understand how nucleosome positions are determined in vivo. The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of chromatin, which has 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around eight copies of core histones. It has been known that many parameters, including the physical property of DNA, DNA binding proteins, ATP-dependent chromatin structure and passage of RNA polymerases, can affect nucleosome positioning. However, how these parameters work together to determine nucleosome position in vivo is not known. We are using genomic approaches to uncover the fundamental rules that determine the positioning of nucleosomes in vivo.	http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/profile/tsukiyama-toshio	NA	Any	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			58465;78259

Missing data and measurement error are very practical and interesting problems. Due to certain reasons, such as high cost, some data can only be collected for a small subsample. For example, food frequency questionnaires are commonly used to assess dietary intake for most study participants, while other instruments such as 4DFR may be subsequently administered only to a subsample of participants to reduce costs. Other factors of missing data problem may be due to the design eligibility criteria. The Women's Health Initiative's dietary intervention trial is a standard example. Furthermore, nutrients are often measured with error. Ignorance of the measurement error may sometimes dead to considerable bias to the study results. Dietary intervention trials have been strategies for the nutritional prevention of cancer. This leads to a covariate measurement error problem in regression models. A closely related problem arising from the regression analysis of two-stage case-control studies. To this problem, I have developed some parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric methods. I am also interested in the missing data and measurement error problem in censored failure time data. Some work has been done in this field. Recently, I have been working on regression analysis when the disease outcome is related to longitudinal data which are observations from a random effects model. This problem is often called joint modeling or two-stage modeling. The primary regression is to relate disease outcome to some latent covariates, while the auxillary data regression is to model covariate data.	http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/wang-ching-yun.html	NA	Leukemia;Lymphoma;Myeloma	Researcher			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			17030;121347

Tumor tissue directly from surgical resection is used to establish patient-derived primary cell lines and tumor lines that grow as brain xenografts in mice. These patient-derived cancer models are subjected to high throughput screening to identify novel therapeutic targets. We recently used a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify PHF5α as a novel gene required for glioblastoma (Hubert et. al., Genes and Development 27:1032-1045; 2013). This work showed that PHF5α helps with proper messenger RNA splicing in cancer cells and provides a lead for novel glioblastoma therapies.  The Olson lab pioneered the clinical use of small cysteine-rich proteins called knottins or when it conjugated a fluorescent dye to chlorotoxin to develop 'Tumor Paint'. Tumor Paint accumulates in cancer cells and is used to help surgeons distinguish tumor from healthy brain tissue during surgery. It is currently in clinical trials. Building on this work, the Olson, Strong, Paddison, and Simon labs have developed a new peptide drug discovery platform at Fred Hutch.  The 'optide' (optimized peptide) platform integrates advanced protein design in silico with a proprietary protein production platform to discover and develop drugs for cancer and neurologic diseases.

He has been developing proteomics-based tools to facilitate biological research.  Specifically, he has pursued a proteomics approach to systematically identify the direct substrates of protein kinases.  Mapping kinase and substrate relationships is critical for elucidating kinases functions and their signaling pathways.  Despite the enormous interests and efforts in the field, it has remained a technical challenge, and the progress has been slow.  He developed an in vitro-based method for proteome-wide identification of protein kinase substrates in cell lysates.  This method utilized tools in biology, protein chemistry, and mass spectrometry and identified an unprecedented large number of candidate substrates for the human CDK2 kinase.  Current in vitro and in vivo approaches suffer the shortcoming of large false-positive identifications due to non-physiological settings or indirect hits.  He is now working on a cell-based approach that would minimize false-positive identifications due to the non-physiological settings while maintaining direct kinase-substrate relationships.	https://www.systemsbiology.org/yong-chi	NA	Colorectal	Staff Scientist			NA	TRUE	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Most of their research has focused on the E6 and E7 oncogenes of the HPVs that have a high risk of progression to cervical cancers, such as HPV 16. In addition to mechanistic studies, the Galloway lab has had long-standing collaborations with epidemiologists and clinicians to understand the natural history of genital HPV infections, and the risk factors that cause only a small subset of women infected with high risk HPVs to progress to cancer. More recently, they have begun to study a different group of HPVs, known as the genus beta HPVs. These beta HPVs commonly infect skin, and may play a role in squamous cell skin cancers (SCSC). They have developed new serologic assays to detect antibodies to many HPVs and to human polyomaviruses.

Building tissues and organs during embryogenesis involves a series of exquisite morphogenetic processes including precisely orchestrated tissue contractions, foldings and migrations. Many of the naturally occurring epithelial movements that shape the embryo during morphogenesis are similar to those employed in the wound healing response and to cell behaviors in tumor progression. The Parkhurst lab uses developmental, genetic, cell biological, and molecular approaches to look at different regulatory mechanisms and pathways required for proper Drosophila embryonic development. Their current efforts are divided between studies of: (1) molecular and cellular mechanisms of single cell and multicellular (tissue) wound repair; (2) actin and microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics mediated by the Rho1 small GTPase and its effectors Wash, Capu, and Spire; and (3) nuclear architecture and organization.

I treat my patients as though they are my family members. I will do everything I can to help patients navigate through the complexity of today's health care system. I always try to explain medical problems in terms that patients can understand. I have a focus on solid tumors, with particular emphasis on breast, prostate and colon cancer. Chances are, I can explain things in ways that make good sense to you. I believe that each patient is a complex individual with his/her own unique biopsychosocial components. What this really means is that I care about how you feel, how you want to be treated, how you live, and how life has affected you. I don't just treat your disease; I treat the complete you. Unlike, most modern days physicians, I do spend a reasonable amount of time with my patients and address all of their concerns. I understand that when you need to see your doctor, you don't want to wait 1 to 2 months for an appointment. My office always has same day appointments available for acute illnesses. My staff and I always work hard to ensure that your waiting time in the office is minimal. Please try to call for my availability before you come.	https://www.northshorelij.com/find-care/find-a-doctor/hematology/dr-paul-alan-cecil-greenberg-md-11348817	NA	Breast;Prostate;Colorectal	Clinician			NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA			48;5856
